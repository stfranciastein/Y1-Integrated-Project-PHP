(3, 'Father John Misty - Chloe & The Next 20th Century', '<p>Josh Tillman is back with a new album. The slippery singer-songwriter remains bewitching, as sprightly brass-tinged arrangements deepen his songs’ darkness and brighten their romance. The ‘God’s Favourite Customer’ follow-up gives a different side to Tillman’s music.</p>', '<p>Two things recur with peculiar frequency around Father John Misty: films and dreams. You’ve heard his wife Emma is a filmmaker; or you might recall that wild story he made up about the time Lou Reed appeared to him in a dream; or you’ll remember his songs, the way the Warner Bros. logo looms over “Leaving LA.” Like David Lynch, Josh Tillman dreams in absurdity, a glamorously mundane world populated by seedy characters hidden beneath the surface. This is the Misty land, the dreamscape, and everyone who encounters his work crosses into it, consciously or not. He’s the folk singer for these times because the aura of unreality follows him around like a stench.</p><p>Anyway, here we have Chloë and the Next 20th Century, from the mind of an auteur who specializes in oneiric theory and mid-century film scores. His latest album is another collection of story-song vignettes arrayed in loose opposition to the pointless absurdity of modern society; or it’s an elaborate study in the life of a sad sack helplessly ensnared in doomed romances with a whole series of women, starting with Chloë, an unfeeling socialite whose previous boyfriend met a mysterious end in the first of, by my count, six tragic deaths in 51 minutes; or it was a dream all along.</p><p>What Chloë looks like, though, is a film. The old-timey opening credits roll for five minutes in the “Q4” video, but the action never begins. There are uncredited cameos: You can read “Funny Girl” like a blind item about Drew Barrymore from the perspective of a delusional fan, and in my mind the umlaut hovers over the image of another generationally famous Chloë, Sevigny. From the first sour trumpet, Misty is working overtime to entertain, tapping into a strain of golden age Hollywood jazz and swing that feels at first like a ludicrous posture for a folk-rock star. Few in our present era of obsessively nostalgic pop have dug all the way back to mid-century big band orchestration and jazz crooners like Johnny Mathis and Chet Baker. Misty looks here because it represents the period when movies were the most advanced and important popular multimedia form—easier than writing for the metaverse, in any case, and just as transportive.</p><p>Still, it’s a record, so you’ll have to watch in the dim theater of your own mind. The new album shares a number of themes with 2017’s Pure Comedy, Misty’s last great throwing-up-of-hands, but instead of manifestos and literalism, Chloë has the amnesiac effect of a film without phones or calendars. It feels designed to age well because it sounds a bit ageless, trimming back the earlier album’s instrumental interludes and replacing its curdled, Trump-scented atmosphere with melodies and stories of no era in particular. From this point, things get slippery: There’s no clear narrative, and the stories are riddled with innuendo and unanswered questions. In place of Pure Comedy’s logorrhea, Chloë suggests the framework of an ambitious novel: Perhaps the story begins with the wedding band of wooly closer “The Next 20th Century,” and ends, 11 songs earlier, as poor Chloë leaps off a balcony.</p><p>But Chloë is ultimately a background character, more like a concept, a sometime foil and frequent obsession for our determinedly dislikeable leading man. The narrator never gives a name, though he shares a few habits with someone we’ve met before, such as a tendency to save the big reveal for the final stanza, or to express some genuinely affecting sentiment like, “Love’s much less a mystery/Than who you give it to,” and subsequently make a pass at a celebrity. In “Funny Girl,” he falls for a comedian: She’s barely over five feet tall, a vivacious interviewee who once “charmed the pants off Letterman.” Convinced she returns his affections, he asks her to meet and arrives at the appointed time, but she’s nowhere to be found; it’s not clear she ever knew he existed.</p><p>Most songs share a similar tenor: pompous and sordid and really terrifically campy. If you subscribe to the narrator’s continuity, you’ll also have to accept that the guy who’s filching Chloë’s pills and stalking talk show guests is the same one singing “Kiss Me (I Loved You)” and cradling his dying cat in “Goodbye Mr. Blue,” easily the saddest death of them all. The pleasure of making his acquaintance is a sensation between schadenfreude and pity, and Misty knows it, because he writes the “Glory Days” scene right in, on a bitter dive bar weeper called “Buddy’s Rendezvous,” as in, “I’m at Buddy\'s Rendezvous/Telling the losers and old timers/How good I did with you/They almost believe me, too.”</p><p>Look closer: Nothing about the Chloë story adds up. The album is full of unfinished arcs, open questions that could turn the ship in an entirely new direction if only someone were steering. On “Olvidado (Otro Momento),” when Misty starts singing bossa nova in Spanish and not Portuguese—where are we? The unhappy couple killed en route to a one-night stand on “We Could Be Strangers”—who were they? And what did he say happened to Chloë’s last boyfriend—were we ever sure? Give the record half an ear and the stories are a little too clever and intricate to register; devote full attention and their meanings start to evaporate because there’s nothing solid there either. This isn’t the structure of a script but the logic of a dream.</p><p>Except for “Q4,” when we briefly wake up to reality, maybe. It’s the album’s most self-contained episode, the only one you couldn’t call a love song: a scandalous story of an author who steals the life story of her late sister as fodder for her own new “semi-memoir.” If the peacocking instrumental is a little over the top, it’s befitting of these characters’ preening attitudes. “It was just the thing for their Q4/‘Deeply funny’ was the rave refrain,” Misty crows, a fictional plagiarized bestseller standing in for a whole history of tension between art and commerce. “What’s ‘deeply funny’ mean anyhow?” he asks the next time the chorus comes around, and then, later, tosses out another of those lines that threaten to give up the whole charade: “The film adaptation was a total mess.”</p><p>It can feel like Misty is in danger of spinning out, but for most of the album, what’s so impressive is the subtlety of his control. The band—including frequent collaborators Drew Erickson and Jonathan Wilson, plus a string quartet and eleven orchestra members—play with silvery poise and high drama. The characters may be odious and dissolute, but the way Misty sings about them is delightful, from the debonair delivery of “Chloë” to the little retro-microphone vibrato that creeps into “Kiss Me.” “Only a Fool” plays like an aspiring songbook standard, its timeless romantic premise flirting with the sly, overeducated Tillman setup: “The wisdom of the ages/From Gita to Abraham/Was written by smitten, lonely sages/Too wise to ever take a chance.” He’s no longer the oldest man in folk rock but the youngest lounge singer in 1950s California.</p><p>But like a big Hollywood production, what’s sparkle and pizazz on camera is pain and doubt behind the scenes. The playfulness dissolves with album closer “The Next 20th Century,” a moody, hallucinatory dirge that slinks through the shadow of Leonard Cohen’s “Death of a Ladies’ Man” with the gimlet eye of Howard Hughes in an empty theater. We’ve finally reached the perspective of the viewer and it’s not looking good: Oppression looms like original sin and love pays “for like a thousand different wars.” “And now things keep getting worse while staying so eerily the same,” Misty croons, spinning a karmic wheel and landing on the creeping suspicion that the next 20th century is this one. He’s come, jeembles and all, to ask if entertainment is the best sustenance we have left, and for the first time, he says yes. “I’ll take the love songs/And give you the future in exchange,” he offers, not too generously. It’s a familiar idea from Misty’s past songs, that in the last analysis we have only each other, and perhaps music, but it feels more hopeless somehow, here at the end of this modern relic of an album with no happy love songs at all. The past is irretrievable, the present wasted, the future doesn’t exist: onward to the dreamland.</p>', 'images/3.png', '<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_vrLZdHN2U?si=m4RUwhCvegL_AFQH\">\r\n</iframe>', 1, 2, 1, '2024-03-03 19:09:34', '2024-03-04 19:09:34'),
(4, 'Mitski: how the US songwriter scored the year’s quietest global chart smash', '<p>An outlier amid pop stars and club bangers, My Love Mine All Mine is getting millions of streams a day. Its singer is reaching new fans – and repairing her relationship with old ones</p>', '<p>An outlier amid pop stars and club bangers, My Love Mine All Mine is getting millions of streams a day. Its singer is reaching new fans – and repairing her relationship with old ones</p><p>On Wednesday night at London’s Union Chapel, the only giveaway that we were in the presence of one of the biggest hits in the world was the sudden glow of phones recording from the pin drop-silent pews. As Mitski sang the gentle country ballad My Love Mine All Mine, the Japanese American songwriter swayed softly, held her heart and gazed at the church’s high carved ceiling as she asked the moon to preserve her earthly love and shine it down long after she’s gone. But the screams that followed were an unmistakable sign of the near religious devotion the 33-year-old commands, even before she climbed up to the pulpit for her encore.</p><p>That song, from Mitski Miyawaki’s acclaimed seventh album, The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We, is now being played around 4m times a day on Spotify and is at No 12 in their global daily Top 50. It will probably hold fast for a second week at No 15 in the UK singles chart and is vaulting up the US Hot 100. Today (13 October), this strange, lunar ballad joins the likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Travis Scott and various high-speed club bangers on the BBC Radio 1 playlist.</p><p>My Love Mine All Mine is an unlikely success story: keeping company with big-ticket pop stars, it feels of a piece with breakout ballads such as Lana Del Rey’s Video Games or Rodrigo’s Drivers License. “This generation of listeners care less about which genre they align themselves with,” says the Icelandic jazz-pop star Laufey, 24, who shared a TikTok video of herself being overwhelmed by the song. “They focus on lyricism, community and how music makes them feel. It’s very encouraging to see a song like this soar.” Its prominence is also a surprise given Mitski’s antipathy towards the spotlight, a stance fostered by her initial experience of virality.</p><p>The rise of My Love Mine All Mine was fuelled by TikTok, where it is currently the platform’s most popular song. It isn’t her first hit on the site: in 2020, her kaleidoscopic pop song Nobody, then two years old, became a meme, soundtracking goofy clips of young people sprinting away from their problems. It broke her beyond an indie listenership enrapt by her “way of finding words for emotions you didn’t even know you had”, says Laufey. It changed the tenor of her fanbase, expanding to a younger faction who often characterised her as a “sad girl” thanks to her bleakly poetic lyrics and ratcheted the level of screaming at her gigs to quasi-Beatlemania levels. Rifts emerged between new and old fans and between Mitski and her obsessive admirers: she reported being grabbed at gigs and feeling exploited by the way her music was consumed, describing herself as a “black hole” for people to dump their feelings into.</p><p>Her 2022 album Laurel Hell was the last on her contract for US indie label Dead Oceans, and with its grim songs about her contract with the public – not to mention uneasy flirtations with a pop sound – was widely perceived as a retirement salvo. “That made the music hard to listen to,” says Pitchfork associate editor Cat Zhang, “because it felt like by supporting her, you were contributing to her suffering.” Soon after its release, Mitski asked people not to film her performances, which prompted a backlash from some fans who said their mental health circumstances necessitated filming as a memory aid. The request was deleted from her social media, which was run by her management after Mitski had quit posting in 2019 to protect her private life. At the end of the tour, she disappeared from view. So it was a surprise on many levels when she popped up on TikTok in July with the simple announcement that she was releasing a new album this autumn.</p><p>The spooked country sound of The Land Is Inhospitable … received widespread acclaim, with Guardian critic Alexis Petridis praising Mitski’s ability to “slip between the heartfelt and the sardonic without ever losing [her] grip on the listener” in a five-star review. But Mitski’s own promotion for the album has barely extended beyond brief TikTok videos about a few songs, one radio interview and a video about My Love Mine All Mine for the lyric-explainer website Genius. (“This is the first record where I absolutely stopped caring what people think,” she said in the clip. “Ironically, maybe that’s what people are the most attracted to.”) Jon Coombs is vice-president of A&R at Secretly Group, the parent company of Mitski’s label, Dead Oceans. “It was important for her for the focus to be on the music and on the songs,” he says. “She’s really proud of it.”</p><p>The album was led by the single Bug Like an Angel, a choir-buoyed strum about the uneasy comfort of alcohol. My Love Mine All Mine was the second single but an immediate favourite at the label, says Coombs. Mitski frequently sings about loneliness and insufficiency; when she sings about falling in love, she might liken it to falling “as fast as a body from the balcony”. My Love Mine All Mine, about wanting one’s love to live on for eternity, “is relatively straightforward and uncommon for her catalogue”, says Coombs. “Of course, it’s not paint-by-numbers. Mitski flips it on her head – it’s a love song about her own love.”</p><p>Mitski’s message of one’s love being the only thing anyone truly owns is resonant in an extractive consumer culture, says Zhang. “She’s showing us the value of giving ourselves freely in a world that conditions us to demand more, more, more.” And her singing to the moon raises the stakes: “She is asking us to reckon with the relative insignificance of our daily struggle and to invest in the only thing that can lend our existence a kind of cosmic meaning.”</p><p>With Mitski all but absent from the public eye, the growing ubiquity of My Love Mine All Mine has become a meta embodiment of the song’s desire for her love to exist outside of her, a stand-in for the boundary-conscious songwriter – who once toured wearing kneepads, underscoring the limits to which she would flay herself for an audience. Its streaming stats are growing daily, says Coombs, and connecting “in places that are uncommon for us to see a ton of engagement, like the Philippines, south-east Asia, Mexico”. There has been no single flashpoint propelling the song beyond the Mitski hardcore. “What’s so exciting is that we can’t point to one particular opportunity or country or partner,” says Coombs. “We’re just seeing this groundswell of people connecting with it across the board, regardless of how they’re first hearing it. I wish I had something to point to because then it would be easier to repeat.”</p><p>Hers is a singular success among complex female songwriters, too. Mitski has joked that her new album’s wordy title is indebted to Fiona Apple’s ornate way with a name; in the 90s, the prodigious US songwriter reached No 21 on the Hot 100 with Criminal, her lone singles chart placing. That decade Tori Amos and Björk often troubled the UK Top 40, but adventurous indie musicians haven’t thrived in the charts in the streaming era: comparable musicians such as St Vincent, Sharon Van Etten and Angel Olsen have never had a conventional hit; Phoebe Bridgers, the breakout indie star of recent years, has only dented the US singles chart as a guest on songs by superstars Taylor Swift and SZA. Why Mitski? “I keep going back to the strength of the song,” says Coombs. “She’s always had a very engaged fanbase that is pretty singular. I think it has to do with how her writing really strikes to the heart of her fans.”</p><p>Unlike some viral songs, where a single’s success doesn’t translate across the rest of the album, Mitski’s whole catalogue has been uplifted: before the release of The Land Is Inhospitable …, her monthly Spotify listening figures were around 10m, says Coombs. A month later, they stand at 18.9m. Her current tour of intimate venues sold out so quickly that Mitski implored fans not to buy vastly inflated resale tickets, with some listed for more than £300 on the secondary market. (One tell of her popularity: the bootleg merch sellers hawking terrible T-shirts outside Union Chapel, not something you often see at indie shows). On previous album cycles, Mitski broke from her own dates to support major pop stars Lorde and Harry Styles on their headline tours. As for Mitski’s coming year, “that’s not something that’s on my radar at the moment,” says Coombs. “The overwhelming majority of the shows on this upcoming run are going to be seated theatres. It makes for a listening experience where you can really listen and absorb the songs.”</p><p>It speaks to Mitski’s desire to reset the terms of engagement with her fans, a challenge that many musicians attempt and fail (Doja Cat is currently leading an offensive against hers), and a feat that may seem unlikely as her profile is higher than ever. But Mitski’s seem to be listening. At the US shows before this UK run, says Coombs, the screaming had stopped and the audience was silent. And the most-watched TikTok interactions with My Love … are noticeably different from her many previous viral songs. Rather than subverting it, many listeners are taking it as a prompt to share their emotional responses and experiences of love.</p><p>The song probably went viral because of its relative simplicity compared with the other songs on an open-ended and existential record, says Zhang. But it’s also consoling young people “who feel romantically lost and confused”, she says. “The sentiment is: even if someone didn’t value the love you gave them, that doesn’t mean that it was a waste. She’s lending dignity to the act of devotion, when we are taught that it is shameful to expend so much energy on others.”</p><p>Appreciating the dignity in devotion might also apply to Mitski’s renewed fondness for her fans. She told NPR that she never intended to quit music altogether after Laurel Hell, but questioned whether she should continue working in the public eye. “But, eventually, I kind of looked around and realised just how lucky I was to get to create the music I want to make and have my music reach other people,” she said. “And I just realised: you know what? I need to buckle up in a sense, and just take all of the good that comes with the bad.”</p><p>Outside Union Chapel on Wednesday afternoon, Ogulcan (17), Abbie (16), Rosa (22) and Shenel (17) are sheltering under umbrellas and blankets at the front of the queue for the unreserved seating, having arrived at 6am. Rosa, who travelled from Madrid, mentions an infamous incident in the Mitski fandom. “At a show seven years ago somebody yelled at her, ‘I love you!’ and she said, ‘You don’t know me.’ But two days ago in Manchester, she was like, ‘I really do love you, I think it’s possible even though we don’t know each other.’ That was really nice.”</p><p>Watching from the balcony, I spot the four in their well-earned front-centre spot, as Mitski performs a spellbinding acoustic set with two musicians playing acoustic guitar and double bass. They do the entire new album in order to a transfixed, utterly silent audience, who cheer ecstatically in polite bursts after each song. Mitski says very little, pacing the stage in all black, other than to thank the crowd and joke about how much she’d like to haunt the chapel. “OK,” she says after that, “let’s get back into character,” lightly mocking her own preference for distance.</p><p>After The Land Is Inhospitable … closer I Love Me After You, she introduces an encore of some of her greatest hits. “Feel free to sing along if you’d like,” she says. “It is a church after all, it’ll be nice to hear a lot of voices singing, if you don’t mind.” And she and the congregation sing in perfect harmony.</p>', 'images/4.png', '', 2, 3, 2, '2024-03-01 19:09:34', '2024-03-01 07:09:34'),

(6, 'Why Have We Forsaken Kings of Leon?', '<p>We love to romanticize the music from our halcyon days, writes GQ columnist Chris Black, so how is it that we have overlooked one of the great bands of the ‘00s?</p>', '<p>I like a lot of music that isn’t considered cool right now. I don’t listen to Burial, Four Tet, or Bladee; I try to listen to Lana Del Rey once a week, but she doesn’t do it for me. I am happy with R.E.M. and Teenage Fanclub. I listen to Third Eye Blind and Uncle Tupelo. Recently, I dug deep and put “Manhattan” by Kings of Leon on the AirPods, and it blew me away. It has this dreamy, nostalgic quality that has aged very well. I listened to it a few times and then dove into the band’s catalog, and my memory was correct—they have several songs from multiple albums that hold up. As a culture, we love to go back and romanticize the music from our halcyon days. So why haven’t we done that with Kings of Leon?</p><p>I don\'t know where you were in 2003, but Kings of Leon was utterly unavoidable if you were in England or paying attention to any music press. Their debut EP, Holy Roller Novocaine, and subsequent LP, Youth and Young Manhood, garnered a level of attention that no guitar band could achieve in today’s musical landscape. They had a signature look, lots of hair, skintight jeans, and leather boots. They partied hard, fought with each other, and dated actresses and models, like a god-fearing, Southern-fried version of The Strokes, or Oasis meets The Black Crowes meets Lynyrd Skynyrd.</p><p>The band consists of three brothers—Caleb, Jared, and Nathan Followill—and a cousin, Matthew Followill. The brothers grew up in Oklahoma and Tennessee, but their father was a traveling United Pentecostal Church preacher, so they were often on the road with their parents. You couldn’t write a better backstory. The rumor was that the parents did some snake charming; it\'s unproven, but I like to believe it. Adds to the mystique.</p><p>The music was bluesy, late-‘60s garage meets ‘70s guitar rock with a sort of hillbilly groove. The first song that really struck me was “California Waiting,” an infectious and scrappy tune in which Caleb’s vocals call to mind both Eddie Vedder and Neil Young. Remember, this was when a lot of popular music had cocaine-fueled garage energy. (The White Stripes never did it for me, still don’t.) Youth and Young Manhood peaked at number three in the United Kingdom but never cracked the top hundred of the Billboard album chart in the United States.</p><p>But then they got too big. “Sex on Fire” and “Use Somebody,” from 2008’s Only by The Night, were chart-topping smashes my mom would know the words to. They cut their hair, married, had kids, and started sounding like U2, which isn’t necessarily bad (“Unos, dos, tres, catorce” and the iPod fiasco excluded), but the tide shifted. They released a few stinker albums. Still, those shouldn’t erase the good ones. Are our memories that short?</p><p>A few of my Twitter followers alerted me to the fact that there had been some Kings of Leon chatter on Time Crisis, the Apple Music radio show hosted by Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig and Jake Longstreth. In episode 196, Koenig plays several songs from the Kings of Leon catalog, even “Sex on Fire”; most of the cast, known music heads, don’t know it. It blew my mind. The song was inescapable. Maybe you had to be the right age. Perhaps you had to listen to rock radio. Koenig points out that part of the appeal is the authenticity: the Southern drawl, the emotional singing, the lyrics, the “blood harmonies.”</p><p>Kings of Leon are in a weird space, seemingly old enough for nostalgia but not young enough to be new and cool. They exist in a purgatory where you can play arenas worldwide, but to most people feel like a relic of their barfly days. It reminds me of Coldplay, a band that has damaged their legacy with strange stage costumes and lousy music. We often forget that their debut, Parachutes, was a huge cool record hailed by the music press. “Yellow” still slaps, and so does “California Waiting.” Nostalgia can be stifling, but great songs should always outlast obscene fashion choices, drug problems, and offensive bangs. Guilty pleasures don’t exist!</p>', 'images/6.png\r\n', '', 5, 1, 5, '2024-02-22 14:09:52', '2024-03-01 14:09:52'),

And realising how fast those moments pass.\"</p><p>It\'s a sentiment echoed on \'Hollow\', about the impact the loss of a loved one can have on the people they leave behind.

(8, 'Father John Misty’s Quest to Explain Himself', '<p>The indie-rock provocateur says he wants to be “authentically bogus rather than bogusly authentic.”</p>', '<p>In the chronicles of Father John Misty, the thirty-six-year-old singer-songwriter whose real name is Josh Tillman, the cardinal psychedelic encounter has him naked in a tree, in Big Sur, in 2010, zonked on magic mushrooms. At the time, Tillman was the drummer for Fleet Foxes, the popular indie folk band, and was living in Seattle. He’d also made eight mostly neglected albums of gloomy folk music under the name J. Tillman. Amid interpersonal discord, creative frustration, and turning-thirty discontent, he split town in an Econoline van, with a big bag of mushrooms, and meandered down the coast. One day, he went for a hike, and, as the psilocybin kicked in, he began to shed layers of clothing, until he found himself perched on a limb, stripped bare before an indifferent universe. Scratching himself, he thought, I’m an albino ape, and I can do whatever I want. He realized that he didn’t have to identify himself exclusively with his disappointments as a musician or with his bitterness about being in someone else’s band: “I should just be myself.” “Myself” was a funnier, more playful, more self-lacerating—and just plain lacerating—version of whoever he’d tried to be as J. Tillman. He returned to Seattle, packed up his things, moved to Los Angeles, and started working on a novel. He recognized his voice in it, in a way that he hadn’t in his music. After a while, he picked up a guitar and started writing songs again, and these, too, seemed different. One of the songs was a country-rocker called “I’m Writing a Novel.” The hook went, “I’m writing a novel, because it’s never been done before.”</p><p>This is when he invented the alter ego of Father John Misty—or, in his rendering, discovered a truer self and gave it a name. The moniker, he has often said, is a random and admittedly silly collection of syllables. But it accommodates his unease about the role of the singer-songwriter and the characters one has to play onstage. “There’s something innately false about performance,” he told me. “I wanted to be authentically bogus rather than bogusly authentic.”</p><p>The first Father John Misty album, “Fear Fun,” came out in 2012. Critics loved it. It was a fresh-sounding folk-rock record full of witty, withering songs about Tillman’s decadent adventures in Hollywood. His clear tenor served as a gorgeous deadpan. He’d found a way to be both flamboyant and self-deprecating, to make art out of making fun of himself and others like him who were engaged in the vain act of making art. A pair of foldup four-by-four-foot posters included in the vinyl release of the album contained, in impossibly small script, the text of that novel, which he called “Mostly Hypothetical Mountains.” “I liked relegating this thing I’d worked really hard on to a gag,” he said recently.</p><p>Two more albums followed—“I Love You, Honeybear,” in 2015, and “Pure Comedy,” this spring. Along the way, the creation of the semi-satirical Father John Misty persona, this handsome devil with a big beard and a forked tongue, had put in motion a cycle of provocation and retort that became a kind of performance art, played out mainly on the Internet—in the corner of it, anyway, that’s obsessed with the poses and codes of indie musicians. He tangled with his critics, pulled social-media pranks, and gave loquacious high-wire interviews while drunk or high, often dropping pretentious or contentious pronouncements. He could seem to be in control of all this, even as he himself often appeared to be out of control: simultaneously conductor and train wreck. He’d built a post-modern fun house. Some came to love him more because of the bluster and brag, or to like him in spite of it, but many declared him insufferable. Whatever the case, people were talking about him. He’d become a meme, as he later put it, in a mocking kind of way—think-piece catnip, a Miley Cyrus for the clever kids. He’d invited you to say Father John Misty is what you’d get if Harry Nilsson, Loudon Wainwright III, James Taylor, Elton John, Randy Newman, Kanye West, Jim Morrison, Eminem, Captain Beefheart, and Warren Zevon had a baby.</p><p>“This” was a link to a column by the eminent critic Greil Marcus, on Pitchfork, the music Web site. “Father John Misty is a persona, one of those people . . . who perform as—who perform as artists of such pretentiousness you couldn’t possibly figure out how to talk to them,” Marcus wrote. “Such characters allow themselves to appear as if touched by God, which is what they’re selling, and laugh at you if you’re so square not to know who they really are: to join their club.”</p><p>“Of all people, greil marcus is getting hung up on persona,” Tillman texted me. “What a fucking dum dum.” Dylan, Johnny Rotten, Madonna, Sun Ra: everyone makes a mask. A couple of decades earlier, Marcus had written, “Perhaps the most pernicious strain of contemporary criticism says one thing before it says anything else, says it to whatever historical event or cultural happenstance is supposedly at issue: ‘You can’t fool me.’ ”</p><p>The presumption tends to be that Tillman is playing tricks, putting one over on us. Listeners can get their backs up: You can’t fool me. “People think I’m toying with them, playing twelve-dimensional chess,” Tillman said. “And if you take it that way, and you think I’m despicable as a result, I get it, because that is a despicable thing to do. But you’re not getting suckered.”</p><p>ife is album cycles—at least, for a recording artist, in a life without seasons or weekends or kids. An album cycle is the period from the completion of recording, through the rollout and the press campaign, to the last gig on the tour. In April, when I first met Tillman, he’d just released “Pure Comedy.” The ever-evolving argument about him was in full swing.</p><p>The performances were polished, even though he had consumed an unholy cocktail of chemicals. (Later, each time he or his band and crew mentioned that night in my presence they made that universal wide-eyed oh-boy expression of recollected intemperance.) As ever, his pitch was perfect and his look was sharp—his hair swept back above his forehead, in a borderline pompadour, and his trademark beard replaced by a mustache. He did his customary wriggly dance moves: Jaggerish swivels and poses that come off as (and actually seem to be) both ironic and sincere.</p><p>“If you can’t hold two ideas in your head at the same time, you’re not going to get what I do,” he said in April. He’d picked me up on Second Avenue in a livery cab, for a trip out of town. He had on black stovepipe jeans with a small hole in one knee, brown suède pointy zip-up boots, a black T-shirt, and a gray Lemaire overcoat. (“I don’t like sports, I don’t fix cars, so I just buy clothes,” he said.) He was pretzeled in back, a tall man in a small car. From time to time, he cracked his knuckles. “I try to avoid talking about the perception of me in the press,” he told me. “It creates this feedback loop.” It may be that he doesn’t try hard enough. He has a droll, almost effete way of speaking, which he moderates by making fun of himself or of the whole construct of giving interviews. He says, “Brackets, laughs bitterly” to convey some degree of irony or self-loathing. Pronouncement, caveat, thrust, parry. “Once you’re on the hamster wheel of self-justification, it’s hard to get off,” Tillman said. “You’re, like, I can fix this interview with the next interviews.”</p><p>Tillman, by now, had been marinating in the “Pure Comedy” material, and the ideas behind it, for several years. Its origins go back two album cycles, to 2013, when he and his wife, Emma, a filmmaker and photographer, were newly married and living in Echo Park, Los Angeles, in a two-hundred-and-fifty-square-foot adobe house on top of a hill, abutting Elysian Park—urban rustics, living half outdoors. They had a potting shed, where Tillman was writing “I Love You, Honeybear,” largely about what was going on in that adobe. The extended tour for “Fear Fun,” a decadent slog, with a band whose members have, for the most part, since been replaced, had netted Tillman only four hundred dollars. So he went back out on the road with just Emma and the comedian Kate Berlant. Tillman had got a little carried away with the rock-and-roll life style. In his telling, he’d become a “speed freak”—cocaine and Adderall. “I was gray,” he told me. “I was beat down. I thought, I need to take a year off.” When the tour took them through New Orleans, he and Emma hatched a plan to retreat there.</p><p>Tillman went cold turkey—he even quit the Internet—and, at dawn on New Year’s Day, 2014, they left Los Angeles in a U-Haul and drove east. (Some of this is depicted in a thirteen-minute ballad called “Leaving LA,” “Pure Comedy” ’s centerpiece and, for some, because of its length, the album’s greatest stumbling block.) They found a rambling old house in the Bywater, for the same monthly rent as their Echo Park hut. Tillman fell into a depression, wandering around the house in his bathrobe, doing little besides reading and the crossword. Emma was writing a screenplay, at least, and taking pictures. She’d grown up without any siblings on a sailboat in Santa Barbara (her father is a sailmaker); she knew how to occupy herself. “But it was difficult for Josh,” she told me. “Music is his life. It’s the only thing he likes to do. And he genuinely thought he’d never make anything again.”</p><p>He’d been battling depression since he was a teen-ager. “It’s hard to talk about,” he said. “I get this thought where there’s someone out there whose real depression I’m doing a disservice to.”</p><p>After six months, they bought a piano at a junk shop for five hundred dollars, and Tillman taught himself to play. Messing around, he soon found that he was writing songs again. “Songwriting is like encountering a bear in the woods: your body knows before your mind does,” he said. “When you drink that much and do that much speed, it takes a while for your emotions to come back on line. ‘Pure Comedy,’ or the first half of it, anyway, was created in this emotional bubble. I’d been walking up and down Bourbon Street, sober, observing the collective state of stupor—people puking neon purple. It felt like the edge of the country, the edge of the world.”</p><p>His previous records had been written in real time. For “Fear Fun,” he’d go out, raise hell, come home late, and write about it until dawn. For “Honeybear,” he chronicled his romance with Emma as it mutated into a marriage. (He wrote the song “Holy Shit” on the eve of his wedding day: “Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity / What I fail to see is what that’s got to do with you and me.”) For “Pure Comedy,” he sat at the piano for hours at a time, thinking about the human experiment from a distant vantage, as though from space.</p><p>By the time he began recording, last year, with the producer Jonathan Wilson, with whom he’d made his previous two albums, he’d been honing and rehearsing the songs for more than a year. (He’d also forsworn sobriety—selectively.) Thomas Bartlett, a producer and pianist who performs under the name Doveman, and who plays piano on the album, said, “Josh knew exactly how those songs were supposed to go, in a way that was almost irritating. He’d lived with these songs in a really intense way.” Tillman and Wilson wanted to be so fluent with the material that they could record it while tripping on LSD—“to give the thing a little sprinkle of magic,” as Wilson put it.</p><p>“Josh was in tears a goodly amount of the time,” Bartlett said. “I love the part of him that’s ready to have an ecstatic experience.”</p><p>Tillman was single-minded even about the cover art. He sent an e-mail to Ed Steed, his favorite cartoonist. “I hadn’t heard of him,” Steed told me. “I Googled the name and saw a beard man with an acoustic. Thought, I know what this is going to be.” He clicked on a video of “I’m Writing a Novel.” “My assumptions were wrong. It was funny, sexy, great.”</p><p>Tillman sent Steed a link to his performance of “Bored in the USA,” a song from “Honeybear,” a few years ago on Letterman: Tillman starts the song at a piano. When he swivels away, another camera shot reveals it to be a player piano. “Here’s one I have a feeling you’ll appreciate,” he told Steed.</p><p>Steed also checked out the earlier J. Tillman stuff. “That’s what I had been expecting when I saw his photo. Self-important, gloomy.” He added, “I’m sure people will criticize F.J.M. for being egocentric, self-absorbed, but I find the J. Tillman stuff much more deserving of that criticism.”</p><p>Tillman sent him the first half of “Pure Comedy,” requesting only two things: an image, somewhere, of a skeleton pissing into a dumpster fire and another conveying some smidgen of hope. “Hope is a powerful ingredient,” Tillman said. “Just a little is all you need. It’s like adding vanilla bean to something.” Steed drew a dense Hieronymus Bosch-like carnival of depravities and horrors. In the middle of it, a naked couple embrace on a blanket, a manifestation of the album’s faint valedictory message that, as one song puts it, “each other’s all we got.”</p><p>The album, in its sardonic despair, was widely considered, on release, to be a commentary on the age of Trump, but it was written and recorded before Trump was elected, and its bemusement and scorn aren’t limited to any particular person or party. Tillman belongs to the school of thought that believes Trump is a symptom, the leader we deserve. The world is the way it is because this is the way we want it to be. Anyway, he readily acknowledges that the observations about our vanity, greed, and violence, the folly and absurdity of existence, and the fraudulence and hypocrisy of the media, politics, entertainment, and religion aren’t exactly new. But Voltaire and Lenny Bruce, they didn’t make self-conscious folk rock. “The content isn’t that outrageous,” Tillman said. “It’s a question of whether I have the right to say it”—whether the world wants to hear from “another white guy in 2017 who takes himself so goddam seriously,” as he sings in “Leaving LA.”</p><p>“This album isn’t a delivery system for my ideas,” Tillman says. Then he’ll say that the best summation of his ideas is the album. One can certainly strive to keep both assertions in mind at the same time.</p><p>In July, a day after Trump accepted the Republican nomination, Tillman, coming off an all-nighter, took the stage at a festival in Camden, New Jersey, and launched into a harangue about the politico-entertainment complex. “Do we think our hilarious tyrant is going to be met with a hilarious revolution led by hilarious revolutionaries and the whole thing is gonna be, like, entertaining as fuck the whole time?” he asked from the stage. “I always thought that it was going to look way more sophisticated than this when evil happened.” Someone called out, “Play a song!,” but he kept going, a lot of it a paraphrase of the lyrics in “Pure Comedy,” which was still months from being released. Eventually, he played “Leaving LA,” which people mistook for ad-libbing, and a cover of Leonard Cohen’s “Bird on the Wire.” Then he pulled a Yeezy and quit the stage, leaving his paycheck behind. The ensuing Twitter bombardment went on for days, with Tillman popping up now and then to lay down some covering fire, until a certain fatigue set in. Tillman was offended by any suggestion that his behavior was a cynical ploy for attention, that it was anything other than an honest meltdown, albeit an artful one. He told me, “My attitude is, whatever I decide to do onstage, that’s my show.”</p><p>“Ever been to a Christian university?” Tillman asked. We were in the livery cab, en route to Nyack College, an evangelical school twenty miles north of Manhattan. He dropped out of Nyack in the spring of 2002, and hadn’t been back since.</p><p>Tillman was reared in a strict and turbulent evangelical Christian household, in Rockville, Maryland, and, in many respects, his career is an elaborate, improvised rebellion against it. His mother, Barbara, grew up mostly in Ethiopia, the daughter of missionaries. His father, I.C., is an engineer at Hewlett-Packard. They met at a Christian youth group, in Maryland, when they were in junior high, after I.C. had declared himself to be born again.</p><p>Josh is the oldest of four children (he has a brother, Zachary, who is sixteen months younger, and two sisters, Kelci and Amanda, younger by seven and fourteen years) and as a result apparently bore the brunt of his parents’ piety. He doesn’t much like to talk about it in great detail, for fear of being entangled in it again. (He speaks with his parents every few years.) He has always been game, anyway, to talk about the household ban on secular pop music. When the boys were in high school, their father removed the car stereo, to keep them from listening on their drives to and from school. They picked up what music they could at friends’ houses or on a portable radio under the covers, and managed to sneak in a few CDs (Doc Watson, Bob Dylan) under the pretext that they were Christian rock. Josh remembers his father instructing him to smash a Red Hot Chili Peppers album to bits. Josh had come across the band on a pizzeria jukebox. (Barbara Tillman denies that her children’s upbringing was strict, or that there was any ban on secular music. “I.C. was playing pop music all the time!” she said.) All this left him, as he once said, with “a bazillion musical blind spots,” and no real connection to the pop culture of the time. “I feel nothing when I hear Michael Jackson,” he told me. “I never put the Smiths on.” Such deprivation nonetheless begat a pop-culture savant, remarkably adroit at reading and fooling around with the signs and styles: a Horatio Alger story of Generation MTV.</p><p>There was always worship music. It laid the groundwork and still informs the act. His father played acoustic guitar, and his mother sang. He was encouraged to take up the drums, to burn off excess energy. Zach picked up the bass. The Tillman boys sang and played in church. “I remember swelling the cymbals, watching people get more and more agitated by the spirit,” Tillman said. “My brother and I looked at each other, exchanging that ‘Can you believe this?’ look. At that age, you’re so binary with the recognition of hypocrisy, so we were, like, This is a total scam.”</p><p>Josh’s education was an odyssey of religious and secular schools, notably five years in a small non-accredited Messianic Pentecostal Jewish school. There was speaking in tongues, laying on of hands, baptism by fire, slaying of the spirit—his first psychedelic experiences, in a way. He was told that he was possessed by demons. But, if he was possessed by anything, it was anxiety and fear of drama at home. “When I was a kid, like fourteen, I mastered the art of shutting down completely,” he told me. “I was terrified.”</p><p>He didn’t give any thought to college. “I sort of assumed I was just going to pack up a bindle sack and start roaming the earth,” he said. “My parents went crazy with rage.” A member of their church was on the board at Nyack College, and helped get Tillman a spot.</p><p>“Oh my God, these poor children,” Tillman said when we reached the Nyack campus. He needed a cigarette. “We don’t want to be busted,” he said, and so he crossed the road, wandered down a suburban lane, and, half hidden by a stand of bamboo, sucked down a couple of American Spirits—a long, lean gent in an overcoat, with a roué’s mustache, smoking in the shadows near the missionary college.</p><p>He hadn’t told anyone he was coming. We slipped into the chapel as it was filling up with students and slid into a pew in back. We were soon surrounded by athletes, mostly women. Softball uniforms, lacrosse sticks. “More multicultural than when I was here, but it’s basically the same ‘Breakfast Club’ demographic,” he observed. “The ones you really gotta look out for are the fetishists of the individual. The ones with the pierced noses and dyed hair, the leather jacket or the studded belt. They’ve made the concession to rebellion. They’re the ones who go on to become pastors. They’re the real little monsters.” He kept going, in a kind of stage whisper, “Here’s the thing that drove me insane: what is it about Christianity, or this version of it, that is so compatible with late-era capitalism, the cult of the self, the commercial-humanist idea of individuality? Christianity is an adaptable avatar for these social movements. It’s very good at resembling the scenery.”</p><p>Tillman paused. Students were hugging. “That being said, there is no analogue for this in the secular world. The electricity in the air, the pre-service buzz, is a total narcotic to me.”</p><p>On a stage at the front of the chapel were some unattended instruments: a guitar, a drum kit, two pianos, and a row of music stands. “What you’re about to hear is going to sound an awful lot like Coldplay,” he said. “A lot of indie rock skews closely to worship music. This style of worship music operates on a ten-year cultural lag.”</p><p>Eight musicians began to play. “Ooh, kind of a Steely Dan vibe,” Tillman said. He sang along for a while, supplying a high harmony. The singer was playing one of those electric keyboards that hang from your shoulder like a guitar. “Dude, he is leading worship with a fucking keytar.”</p><p>Tillman arrived at Nyack in 1999. “I was here when 9/11 happened,” he said. “The soccer field was full of students gnashing their teeth and asking God for forgiveness for a culture of homosexuality. That began a crazy year here, wild stuff. A whole lot of prophesying. It was widely believed that in May the spirit of God was going to fall on America. The day came, and there were a hundred people in the field, waiting for the national revival.”</p><p>The keytarist was improvising a prayer: “We praise you, God, there’s no one like you. We want you to invade our lives, God, and to be yourself.”</p><p>“This is heartbreaking,” Tillman said. “Ten years ago, I would’ve had a panic attack, coming here. Well, actually, ten years ago a friend took me to church and I did have a panic attack.”</p><p>A junior from the Youth & Family Studies Department stood to deliver a PowerPoint sermon called “Satisfaction in Christ.” “Boring,” Tillman said, after a few minutes. He stood to leave. “When you live in this psychotic cloud of nonsense, the only way to combat it is with clear thinking.”</p><p>“I can’t even tell you how unhappy I was at this place,” he said outside. “Sex was not even within the realm of the possible. I was a virgin till I was twenty-two.</p><p>“I’m a very bizarre mix of variables,” he went on. “People see a caricature of a white know-it-all. But I’m not overeducated. I’m not some kind of blueblood. I didn’t grow up in some bohemian enclave with an artsy outlet. There were zero examples. Anything you hear me say about religion in my songs is incredibly hard-won. I have license to be even more judgmental about it than I am. And it’s not purely conceptual. This is me. And there’s nothing ‘cool’ about it. There is something weirdly, cellularly conservative in me. You can only run so far.”</p><p>When Tillman dropped out of Nyack, in 2002, he hitched a ride to Seattle with a drummer he knew. He lived in the drummer’s brother’s basement. He donated plasma, worked construction, and washed dishes. Seattle was soon to be the epicenter of an indie-folk renaissance—Neil Young acolytes in ponchos and heavy sweaters, with monkish beards and mulled wine. The singing was pretty, the sentiment serious, the mood gentle, if a touch druidic—a post-grunge overcorrection, maybe. Soon, Tillman was writing his own disconsolate songs, recording them at night before taking the dawn shift at a local bakery. A demo tape reached Damien Jurado, a singer-songwriter with a small but reverent following, who asked Tillman to join him on tour. There followed a series of J. Tillman records—eight in all, in about as many years—on a series of labels, plus occasional tours with other bands. His brother, Zach, had moved to Seattle, too, and they lived together for a while in the University District and played on each other’s recordings and at each other’s gigs. People knew about J. Tillman, he had admirers, but despite the persistence nothing quite took. “That stuff, it was a huge inspiration to me, but it’s not getting anyone’s dick hard,” Zach told me. “He’d play these sets of sparse, dry material, and then between songs he’d light the room up with his humor, and then he’d sink back into the music.”</p><p>In 2008, Fleet Foxes, an ascendant Seattle pop-folk troupe characterized by high harmonies, heavy reverb, and delicate, layered orchestration, asked Tillman to sign on as their new drummer. He had the voice and the beard for it. The band was about to release its first album. He quit the construction job and toured with them, as the record garnered year’s-best acclaim. Here was industry success: a global audience, a thriving partnership, real money, and even love, of a kind. (Aja Pecknold, the band’s manager and the older sister of the band’s leader, Robin Pecknold, had become his girlfriend.) But, as work commenced on the next album, “Helplessness Blues,” the collaboration began to fray. Tillman was still making his own music and chafing at the supporting role. “We all started hating each other,” he told the Guardian. “A lot of people have complicated relationships with Robin,” he told me. “I don’t wanna talk about it.” Pecknold, for his part, recently told Rolling Stone that he hasn’t listened to Tillman’s music—“like, intentionally.”</p><p>Videos of the band’s live performances from this time show a sullen drummer, scowling and crossing his arms between songs. Singing such moonlit, almost twee material amid such acrimony felt counterfeit to him. In 2012, while the band was in Japan, Tillman announced that the next show, in Tokyo, would be his last. “Back into the gaping maw of obscurity I go,” he wrote, on his Tumblr. Toward the end of the second-to-last gig, he kicked over his drum set and stalked off the stage. He wound up sobbing in the arms of the band’s keyboard player, as Pecknold improvised a few songs solo.</p><p>Tillman and Emma recently moved to Laurel Canyon, to a two-bedroom house at the end of a cul-de-sac. He’d lived in the neighborhood when he first moved to Los Angeles, and critics drew the inevitable line back to fabled predecessors—Gram Parsons, Joni Mitchell, Crosby, Stills, and Nash. “Yes, that ‘unmistakable Laurel Canyon sound,’ ” Tillman said. “The sound of Laurel Canyon is entertainment lawyers screaming at their dogs.”</p><p>As spring went on, the album cycle called for rehearsals. Tillman gathered his band at S.I.R. Studios, on Sunset Boulevard, in preparation for an appearance at Coachella and then a round of theatre gigs. He’d selected these theatres because he had been planning to put on a musical of “Pure Comedy,” and he wanted the band to be in an orchestra pit. “There were to be trucks full of twelve-foot-tall therapist puppets and giant banana-peel costumes driving around the country,” he told me. “I had builders ready to make sets.” He’d written the musical, he said, “to contextualize the record in its comedy and absurdity, and to drive home how personal it is.” “Personal” seemed a mild way of putting it. His description of the musical made it sound like a Robert Wilson fever dream—on acid. He was to appear onstage as Father John Misty playing the role of Josh Tillman, while the character of Father John Misty was to be played by a troupe of dancers. “Father John Misty and child Josh Tillman are Jungian shadow selves,” he said. “One exists because of the other. They do horrible things to protect each other. And when they meet they die.” He had them, at the end, drowning in a leaky rowboat.</p><p>In February, he had been aboard a flight with his choreographer, en route to New York to audition dancers. “She asked me a question: ‘So why in this scene do you have these Girl Scouts sexually assaulting Mother Earth?’ And I had a panic attack. I was, like, I have to get off this plane. But, obviously, I couldn’t. So, I thought, I have to have a cigarette. Couldn’t do that, either. So I went to the bathroom and e-mailed my manager and said the musical was off.”</p><p>Still, he kept the dates. He’d play rock concerts instead. The arrangements on the album are mostly sparse, to emphasize the vocals, but onstage Tillman goes for a heftier sound; he aims to entertain. He’d be touring with horn and string sections, plus his regulars: a bass player, two guitarists, two keyboardists, and a drummer. At S.I.R., the day I visited, word got around that Kiss and the Foo Fighters were rehearsing in the studios next door. You could hear muffled arena rock in the halls. “If a meteor hit this place, it’d be the end of the male gaze,” Tillman said.</p><p>Tillman has an easy rapport with the guys in his band, who are crack musicians and who, in a few cases, have their own recording careers. (They seem more comfortable with the arrangement than he did as a Fleet Fox.) Tillman had on snakeskin loafers, no socks, the black jeans, and a white shirt with the top few buttons undone. He and his team had learned, earlier that day, that “Pure Comedy” had reached No. 10 on the Billboard pop chart, and was the No. 1 album on the Rock, Alternative, and Americana charts as well. That this was the product of just thirty-five thousand units, in the first week, didn’t dim the thrill of having a hit.</p><p>They ran through a song called “Strange Encounter,” from “I Love You, Honeybear,” about the aftermath of a one-night stand. It begins, “Only ever be the girl who almost died in my house.” In a section after the chorus (“The moment you came to, I swore I would change”), Tillman stopped and said, “Don’t just truck through that bit. Let’s play that section on a loop till it sounds slinky. Let’s pretty that bitch up!”</p><p>Someone dimmed the lights. Next up was “Fun Times in Babylon,” the first song from “Fear Fun.” He sings, in a sad kind of way, “Look out, Hollywood, here I come.” (The music video has him strolling through the smoldering wreckage of an airplane crash, a set left over from Steven Spielberg’s “War of the Worlds.”) Even in the absence of an audience, he threw in some wags of his ass and wristy gestures. Mostly, though, he stood still and made his serious singer-at-work face: lips pursed, nostrils flaring slightly, eyes trained on the middle distance.</p><p>At one point, Dave Grohl, of the Foo Fighters, appeared in the studio. He and Tillman talked near Tillman’s microphone stand. They’d never met, but Grohl acted as if they had—the old assumption that all celebrities know one another, or, at least, drummers from iconic Seattle bands who have gone on to have big careers of their own—while Tillman’s nonchalance edged into indifference. As Grohl was leaving, Tillman called out, “You’re welcome to come in anytime and listen to some folk rock!”</p><p>“Feel free to turn on some lights,” Grohl said.</p><p>“He’s like a Bill Murray of rock: just kind of shows up,” Tillman said when Grohl had gone. “Actually, Bill Murray is the Bill Murray of rock.”</p><p>As the players dispersed, Tillman got behind the drum kit. The sound engineer, Trevor Spencer, picked up a guitar and began playing some distorted riffs. Spencer, who is twenty-seven, started out doing sound with Fleet Foxes and is now Tillman’s right-hand man and all-around Sancho Panza. Tillman, who is constantly changing the name on his Twitter account (Farmer Jah Misery, Feather Jam Ministry, Jon “Trxxxth” Misty), had recently dubbed it “Jazz Imposters,” as he and Spencer uploaded some crappy iPhone videos of themselves scuffling on keyboard and drums. They announced a forthcoming album and an “exclusive JI interview.” Some fans seemed to take this literally. Others knew it was a joke but felt obliged to explain it. Tillman’s news alert filled with blog posts. Then he deleted the tweets—a social-media sigh. MTV.com turned all this into an occasion for a think piece on Internet trolling, from which Tillman, after he and Spencer had finished goofing off, began to read aloud, with disdainful delight: “What purpose does trolling actually serve? In a word: control.” And then, “Trolling creates a window of freedom through which artists can do whatever they’d like for a limited time: While false leads are being chased, they can live their real lives.”</p><p>“So obtuse,” Spencer said. “It was basically a fart joke.”</p><p>“Wait to see how those words look on the Internet,” </p>', 'images/8.png', '', 4, 5, 4, '2024-02-14 14:12:54', '2024-02-15 14:12:54'),

(11, 'Phil Collen names the band that could equal Led Zeppelin', '<p>Many rock bands still pay homage to Led Zeppelin, demonstrating the enduring influence and legacy of the iconic rock group.</p>', '<p>There is still a vast array of rock bands that worship at the altar of Led Zeppelin. From the millions of imitators in the 1970s to Greta Van Fleet’s elaborate way of copying the band’s mannerisms in the modern age, that internal chemistry between every band member has left an indelible mark on what rock and roll was supposed to be. Although many have struggled to measure up to songs like ‘Ten Years Gone’ and ‘Kashmir’, Phil Collen thought that Jeff Beck could have given the group a run for their money.</p><p>Then again, it wasn’t like Jimmy Page and Beck came from two different angles. Throughout their time working in the English blues scene, Page and Beck often crossed paths when working in the Yardbirds, including the apocryphal lineup where Page was relegated to playing bass during their live shows.</p><p>Whenever Beck cranked his amplifier to play, there was no contest about the better guitar player. No one since Jimi Hendrix had been able to make the guitar sound like it was talking whenever they played, which often involved Beck getting a bit antsy with the whammy bar whenever he played live.</p><p>Although Page still had an impressive set of chops after playing on the studio scene, he was still taking notes from what Beck was doing. Through Led Zeppelin’s run, Page was known for pushing the instrument’s boundaries just like his idol did, including raking the strings with a violin bow and exploring alternate tunings to get a chiming sound out of tracks like ‘The Rain Song’.</p><p>As Phil Collen was learning his first licks from the likes of Mott the Hoople and David Bowie, Page and Beck had already been considered untouchable by most rock fans. Although that Zeppelin swagger is coated throughout Def Leppard’s classic licks, Collen always defended what Beck could do with the guitar.</p><p>Going solo around the same time Jimi Hendrix became the biggest name in music, Beck would get to play at the Woodstock festival in 1969 before turning it down to fly back home. Having rock and roll legend Rod Stewart in the lineup at that point, Collen thought that Beck could have been on an equal footing with Zeppelin had he managed to share the stage with Hendrix.</p><p>When talking about the original Jeff Beck group with Rod Stewart singing lead, Collen thought he could go beyond everything Page ever did, telling Guitar World, “It was all instrumental, which was way better. It highlighted his guitar playing. And then we got Rod Stewart in the Faces, so everyone gained from them not doing Woodstock, even though if they’d done it, they could’ve been as big as Led Zeppelin”.</p><p>While Beck would continue finding his voice on his own, he still had a massive impact on every guitar player who came after him. Even if you’re just starting on guitar and trying to eke out the fundamental sounds of the blues, chances are you’ll stumble upon a trick Jeff Beck pioneered without even realising it.</p>', 'images/11.png\r\n', '', 2, 1, 2, '2024-02-23 14:19:49', '2024-02-24 14:19:49'),

Its sleek, uptempo first single, “Houdini,” is out now in tandem with a dance-focused, Manu Cossu-directed music video.</p><p>Parker is joined behind-the-scenes on the album by Caroline Ailin, Danny L. Harle, Tobias Jesso Jr., with Harle also serving as the project’s co-producer. “A lot of this album was written in those joyous moments of absolute chaos and how I moved through the world with lightness and optimism of whatever the outcome may be,” Lipa says.</p><p>As for “Houdini,” Lipa reveals that it “represents the most light and freeing parts of my singledom, ’Houdini’ is very tongue-in-cheek, exploring the idea of whether someone is really worth my while or if I’ll ghost them in the end. You never know where something may take you, that’s the beauty of being open to whatever life throws your way. I’m looking forward to sharing that feeling of defiant bliss with my fans.”</p><p>Lipa hasn’t released an album since 2020’s smash hit Future Nostalgia, but she’s rarely left the spotlight in the time since.

Chapman’s whole catalog saw about 1.81 million streams, a 268 percent increase, and Boygenius’s more than doubled with 2.75 million.</p><p>Joni Mitchell’s moving Grammy debut caused her streams to more than double with about 427,000, even as her music has been off of Spotify since 2022 when she pulled her catalog over misinformation Joe Rogan had aired about the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>', 'images/16.png', '', 5, 1, 5, '2024-03-05 14:31:54', '2024-03-05 15:31:54'),
(17, 'Oh Wonder – 22 Break', '<p>Oh Wonder\'s \'22 Break\' showcases emotional depth and musical evolution, drawing inspiration from personal turmoil to craft a compelling narrative.</p>', '<p>Creativity is a fickle thing. It’s not something you can just switch on and off on a whim, you can’t ask for inspiration and expect it to arrive promptly on a silver platter. It comes and goes as it pleases, and everyone who makes a living in a creative industry constantly has the quiet voice of fear in the back of their mind saying “what if it never comes back?”. But there are always things an artist can do to further sow the seeds of inspiration and encourage it to flourish; the main one of course being a desire to express oneself. While there’s nothing wrong with making something purely for the sake of making something, usually the most impactful art comes from a place of catharsis. Using art as an outlet for pent up emotions; as way of processing and giving voice to feelings that you may not yet fully understand. </p><p>Perhaps counter-intuitively, creativity is also often boosted by giving it constraints. Having a mission statement consisting solely of “make… something” just throws the net too wide and lacks purpose and direction. If instead you add certain boundaries – working in a particular style or medium, pertaining to a certain theme, telling a specific story, or changing some aspect of the creative process itself – it fires up that problem solving part of your brain. When done right that fire spreads. They say necessity is the mother of invention, and often one idea leads to another, and so in trying to just overcome an obstacle in the road ahead you can sometimes find yourself taking flight instead. </p><p>Oh Wonder certainly seem to work best when there’s some structure in place. For their stunning debut album the duo wrote, recorded and released a song a month, before bringing all the creations together into one surprisingly cohesive collection of exemplary electropop. In the years since however, none of their releases have had quite the same spark. Without a structure to build around the ideas just didn’t feel forthcoming. For their latest release the duo started with one deeply compelling framework, and followed the creative vein it uncovered deep into the unknown. Inspired by a rough patch in the pair’s relationship, 22 Break tells the story of break-up as it develops. Starting by giving voice to doubts and fears, together processing feelings they never even realised they were feeling, sharing the bizarre and intimate process of writing a break-up record together, and ultimately finding their way back to each other through the storm. It’s an unusual approach, but anyone that’s ever heard Rumours can tell you how effective it can be to hear both sides of the heartbreak at once.</p><p>Here we have Oh Wonder’s most emotionally charged record to date. Lines like “I wish I’d done more to save us”, “Am I not good enough to be loved by you?” and “I loved you more than I loved myself” just burn with such sincerity. Over the course of these eleven tracks their openness allows you to follow every up and down of the relationship that they’ve chosen to share. You’d expect it to be a tough listen in the best sense of the term, but in fact the pair funnel their feelings through some of their biggest hooks and most earworm melodies in years. Not every track lands, ‘Down’ and ‘Love Me Now’ lean much too heavily on repetition, but the album definitely hits more often than it misses. The title track bounds effortlessly above an emphatic rhythm section, ‘Free’ floats across a dreamy weightless expanse, while the frenetic pre-chorus of ‘Rollercoaster Baby’ builds to a release of dazzling synths. Gorgeous closing track ‘Twenty Fourteen’ is awash with sophistication and elegance thanks to its smooth jazzy sax and bright piano tone reminiscent of Bruce Hornsby, while album highlight ‘Don’t Let The Neighbourhood Hear’ manages to pack everything that the duo excels at into one single track. </p><p>It feels like the band’s most cohesive work yet, not just thanks to the cathartic way it was written, but also down to the shift in musical style that acts as a unifying thread. While the duo have dabbled in samples, vocal effects and the like in the past, they’ve always felt like a distraction before. A thin veneer on filler tracks like fresh paint on an old house. Here however the band take it back to bare brick and build the electronic elements into the very nature of the songs. Paired with the light piano work and splashes of jazz it really stands out from their previous releases and feels like a refreshing new direction. That said, it’s worth addressing the elephant in the room that the album draws a lot of inspiration from Bon Iver’s 22, A Million. From the many stylistic cues it follows in its use of sax, sampling and vocal effects, to the similar artwork and even the shared love of the number twenty two, to say that Oh Wonder are wearing their influences on their sleeves here would be a massive understatement. While it’s not the most original of records, the pair do wear it well and put plenty of their own stamp on the style. 22 Break is the best that Oh Wonder have sounded since their debut and the new sound they’re flaunting is something I’d be keen to hear more of on their next record… although hopefully the couple don’t have to go through quite such an ordeal to get there next time around!</p>', 'images/17.png', '', 9, 2, 9, '2024-02-11 14:41:59', '2024-02-12 14:41:59'),
(18, 'The Origins and Influence of Brian Eno’s Pioneering Album Ambient 1', '<p>In the latest episode of Pitchfork’s podcast, our critics revisit the legendary producer’s classic 1978 LP, which was recently featured in our Sunday Review series.</p>', '<p>Our weekly podcast includes in-depth analysis of the music we find extraordinary, exciting, and just plain terrible, along with interviews with some of our favorite artists. This week Reviews Director Jeremy D. Larson hosts longtime Contributor Grayson Haver Currin for a deep dive into Brian Eno’s Ambient 1: Music for Airports, perhaps the most important ambient album ever made. Currin also recently wrote about the record for our Sunday Review series, in which we revisit significant albums from the past.</p><p>Listen to this week’s episode and read an excerpt from it below. Follow The Pitchfork Review here.</p><p>Grayson Haver Currin: No matter how many times I listen to this record, I always marvel at how it is about limitation. It’s about knowing when to say when. In terms of actual sonic events, they’re pretty few and far between. It is an impressionistic piece of music built on repetition where the idea is that Eno has created a world of sound, but you create a world of meaning within it. That’s something that keeps bringing me back to this piece of music.</p><p>Jeremy D. Larson: Yeah, it’s confrontational. I’ve always made this connection that there’s this horseshoe theory: The loudest music is confrontational, and the quietest music is also confrontational, because it’s demanding a lot from you the same way that extreme black metal demands a lot from you.</p><p>Another interesting thing is that this album came out right around the time the Walkman was invented, in the late ’70s. You can take a cassette of Ambient 1 and walk around with it, and the world that was once confined to a hospital or an airport is now just traveling with you.</p><p>Currin: Eno tried to install this music in places, like he tried to put it in Laguardia Airport. There were various airports that had it, and it was kind of a disaster—people weren’t that into it. But if you have the ability to create your own ambient environment through sound when you put Ambient 1 into a Walkman, or you put an Éliane Radigue record in your phone now and walk to the grocery store, you’re able to create your own environment.</p><p>And I think that\'s such a key part of the ambient boom of the last decade or two. There’s so much ambient music being made now, and so much of it has to do with the idea that you can personalize your sonic space no matter where you are. You can kind of create your own little cocoon, and that’s one thing that Music For Airports has always allowed me to do.</p>', 'images/18.png', '', 4, 3, 4, '2024-02-29 14:34:17', '2024-02-29 15:34:17'),
(19, 'The Musical Age of Shitpost Modernism', '<p>The next generation of underground rappers, electronic misfits, and jazz weirdos have flooded the internet with an approach that is both artful and inane.</p>', '<p>A 16-year-old from Argentina is blowing up with the most puerile plugg rap ever produced. AgusFortnite2008’s deeply overwhelming aesthetic teeters between creative and corny (think Chief Keef worship, graphics that look like diseased MrBeast thumbnails). He cites montage parodies, a video format made by defacing cartoons and video games by editing an hour’s worth of rainbow flashes and memes into every frame, as sonic inspiration. “Some 30-year-old man listens to one of my songs and kills himself,” AgusFortnite2008 joked to me over the phone. “They don’t understand the distortion, the references. It’s a generational appeal.” As someone who obsessively consumed and created montage parodies in high school, my brain nearly broke hearing him explain the way his style takes cues from shitposty internet culture.</p><p>Agus’ music is just one dispatch from the strange new world of what I’m calling shitpost modernism. Imagine if “shitpost” didn’t mean far-right 4channers spamming Dark Brandon GIFs but instead became a zeitgeist-defining aesthetic for music, a new frontier of profane genius that walks the tightrope between cringe and cool. That’s what we’re seeing with things like Yeat’s gospel of gibberish and the viral jazz cluster’s filthy gags, or the surprise hits of Lil Yachty’s “Poland” and Saint Mercator’s “Da Biggest Bird,” a pluggnB tribute to ornithology. Or whatever is going on with the stupendously unpredictable rapper RXK Nephew, whose catalog is a banquet of the bizarre, from a conspiracy-rap odyssey to a track he spends dissing its beatmaker.</p><p>Even megastars have gone silly under the shitpost spell, sidestepping polished musicality in favor of high-low anarchy. Kendrick Lamar vexed oldheads in 2022 when he repeated the phrase “top of the morning” seven times, for no reason, in a fierce tone on the Baby Keem collaboration “range brothers.” Ice Spice’s willfully weird slang has spawned endless memes: “I’m the shit, I’m that bitch, I’m Miss Poopie” is a recent highlight. Her zaniest song to date, “Bikini Bottom,” features her moonwalking over a SpongeBob sample so slapstick it’s like sample drill Charlie Chaplin.</p><p>While novelty tracks have long been a part of selling pop music—from the “Monster Mash” to the “Macarena”—this specific kind of trolly humor largely thrives outside the domain of major-label supervision. It is seen most clearly in rising rap, where the online underground encompasses a diffuse sprawl of scenes and standards that share a cracked sensibility. Take Texas rapper TisaKorean’s folly-filled anthems; his flamboyant silliness is the inverse of major-label rap’s too-clouted-to-care aesthetic, whereby stars like Travis Scott and Destroy Lonely act like resigned CEOs of trillion dollar tech startups.</p><p>The winner for the wildest vocals of 2023 is a man who imitated the constipated croak of SpongeBob SquarePants boss Mr. Krabs. What’s striking about 24-year-old rapper Audwin Gray’s “KRUSTY KREW ANTHEM” is both how convincing the impression feels and the way that, despite its joke-y concept, the song involves genuine skill. So many people thought the vocals were AI creations that Gray, who goes by the artist name Oddwin, had to add a disclaimer on his SoundCloud insisting the song was man-made. It became a hit out of nowhere, flying to No. 1 on Spotify’s viral chart in June.</p><p>Gray tried out his Mr. Krabs voice while messing around at 5 a.m., with no inkling it would infest so many brains. “You never know, some of the greatest ideas can come from having fun,” he told me over the phone. The basic premise is a perfect formula for zoomers, who grew up obsessed with SpongeBob, and whose shared comedic language is internet-fried surrealism. Next to some of the biggest viral trends of last year—people pretending to pass out after drinking Grimace shakes, AI edits of Trump and Biden playing Minecraft, Lizzy Dunne Just Rizzed Up Baby Gronk, the nihilistic mundanity of corecore videos—a rap posse cut stuffed with cartoon sea-animal imitations doesn’t seem so out of place.</p><p>There are modern precursors to this torrent of outlandish brilliance: Dadaist-gibberish cloud rap; the shoddy shimmer of vaporwave; “PISSCORE”; Myspace users and bloggers coining parodic genre names; juvenile YouTube glitch-graffiti. Rather than straight-up comedy music, the shitpost modernists aren’t often explicitly branded as “funny.” The humor and innovation is more oblique: It’s in the degraded structure of the track, the mutant vocals, the shock of a surreal high-low juxtaposition. What also separates this era of artfully inane music is the sheer volume of it and its wide-scale popularity. In a streaming world that prioritizes ephemeral dopamine hits and algorithm-piercing smashes, ideas like radio-readiness or conceptual heft can feel quaint. So instead of trying to appeal to the everyman or the critic, a mass of young musicians are fucking around. The result is a feast of freakiness that’s perfect for zoomer brains that have hatched to (im)maturity in a vat of digital absurdism.</p><p>When eccentric artists like Lil B, IceJJFish, and James Ferraro were rising in the 2000s and 2010s, they were mostly confined to having small cult fanbases who loved their idiosyncrasies. Today’s shitposters have the advantage of Twitter timelines and TikTok’s ForYou page, where personalized algorithms are designed for maximum engagement. There’s nothing particularly egregious about SEBii’s brand of hyper-rap with dopey rhyme schemes, but without fail his clips end up spiraling into full-on discourses because detractors quote-tweet him and say he’s ruining the genre. Shocking sounds that provoke polarizing reactions hold more currency than ever.</p><p>Taste boundaries have also eroded and exploded over the last few years as increasingly far-out hits hurtled out from niche siloes. Remember the outrage when Atlanta rapper 645AR started squeaking like Pikachu in the late 2010s? Yet after TikTok sea shanties, the demonic microgenre sigilkore, a Mario Kart theme song remixed into a trap beat with a fart sound, and countless other meme-y anomalies, barely anyone bats an ear when a song called “Sticking Out Your Gyat For The Rizzler” surges to the top of the algorithm. The viral hit, which consists of a squeaky voice mewling Gen Alpha buzzwords like “skibidi toilet” and “Fanum tax,” inspired a trend last year where people sung the lyrics over alt-rock and classical instrumentation.</p><p>The shitpost modernist virus has infected other genres, most surprisingly jazz, where a new wave of young prodigies are deploying their skills to silly ends. Check out Spilly Cave crafting a tune to soundtrack a bidet spraying and calling it a “WipeTok” tribute, or wunder-duo DOMi & JD Beck, who released a classy debut last year but also make testicle jokes in song titles and play fart noises in concert. Rather than dampening their musicality, the ridiculous gags and uncouth humor adds another layer to the duo’s performances and humanizes their seemingly inhuman dexterity.</p><p>The same strain of shitposter syndrome afflicts hyperpop and zoomer electronica—just listen to the live sets. For Boiler Room earlier this year, 100 gecs blended their future-bass collab with Skrillex into a Five Nights at Freddy’s theme song into Chief Keef’s ferocious “Faneto.” At The Lot Radio, Frost Children wed novelty hits like Ylvis’ “What Does The Fox Say” to pristine house and the sort of vomity brostep every 7th-grader worshiped in 2010. The goal of most professional DJs is to keep listeners hypnotized with a seamless mix; the objective of these producers is to spark sloppy grins when you hear the campy chaos fading in. Attend any 100 gecs show and you’ll see scores of teens and twenty-somethings awash in wizard hats, furry costumes, and colorful fishnets, with Nintendo 3DS cameras flying in the air. These musicians offer not just slapstick music but a kind of light-hearted outlook toward life itself; it’s a childlike retreat from the strictures of seriousness and a refusal to abide by conservative etiquette.</p><p>The music is just one piece of what has become a sprawling shitpost-media complex. Another layer is the Instagram and Twitter meme accounts that pose as news sources and create Biblical mountains of lore about scenes. One of the most influential pages, Hyperpop Daily, is basically the zoomer’s Hipster Runoff, with a focus on the ascendant, fractured wave of underground music instead of indie rock. Launched in late 2020, the page zeroes in on the most astonishing news items (real or alleged) about an artist, like how Destroy Lonely apparently walked off the stage at an in-game Roblox show, using descriptions that fall closer to shitpoems than shitposts. The page’s 24-year-old, Seattle-based creator tells me that his writing style is partly inspired by the adolescent melodrama of stories on Wattpad, a fan-fiction forum. He points to one piece in particular where the author fantasizes that Swedish rappers Bladee and Yung Lean went to his high school. “For some reason, Bladee started self-harming, and I just was like, What the fuck is going on here?” he recalls thinking. “If someone did this ironically, it would make for god-tier content.”</p><p>Consuming music content online used to parallel the analog ways of reading magazines, watching music docs, and chatting with friends. The 2010s were ruled by the casual drop-in-when-you-want vibe of blogs, YouTube videos, and forums. That mode feels snail-paced compared to today’s vortex of startling stimuli, where every career update, review, and beef related to an artist is converted into feed-flooding posts by influencer-blogs like Hyperpop Daily. All the world has become a shitpost: 2023’s hottest “dance” account features the human equivalent of a graduated cylinder bopping ironically next to toilets.</p><p>Despite the occasional work of daft genius drifting across the timeline, there have been countless shitposers. These artists often use painfully cringe aesthetics and shock tactics to chase viral tracks, so how do you discern mastery from milquetoast? Skillful shitposting reveals a thought-through aesthetic and an awareness of when the tastefully madcap turns to pubescent-puerile. Dev Lemons frontloads abrasive humor in her music (she has a collaborative project called QUEEF JERKY), but it’s basically a goading lure. Think it’s all just a cringe meme? Behind titles like “CEO OF MY ASS” are blasts of industrial bass and breakbeats.</p><p>The oddity must also be used as part of a larger vision. 645AR’s helium moans on “4 Da Trap” and “Sum Bout U” convey misery and yearning. Yuno Miles\' ostrich-squeal-rap is built around dexterous and inventive flows. There’s a vulnerable realness to the way these artists defy expectations—of genre, gender, their past music—and risk ridicule. On the flip side, the truly bad shitpassé-modernism has few to zero redeeming qualities. It’s detritus like Mcap Steve’s ear-eviscerating Minecraft remixes of popular songs and the edgelord-core of Lil Darkie, who built an audience by offering shock (see “HOLOCAUST”) to tween boys with dumpster taste.</p><p>The greatest shitpost modernism seems to halt time. We’re living in an era of giga-accumulation: Big-ticket albums have largely been replaced by the monstrosity of 25-track data dumps designed to rack up streams; the daily experience of internet life involves a brain-glazing surf across tweets and TikToks we forget immediately; the music landscape has decentralized into niche nano-pockets But when something absurd like a bizarrely perfect mashup of PinkPantheress and Radiohead comes out, it creates an increasingly rare monocultural moment for the younger generation. It’s so freaky and new-sounding you can’t help but replay it and giggle.</p>', 'images/19.png', '', 9, 3, 9, '2024-02-19 14:34:17', '2024-02-20 14:34:17'),

(21, 'Bon Iver - I,I ', '<p>On his fourth album, Justin Vernon reassembles the familiar Bon Iver elements like a cubist collage, with his voice fearlessly front and center. The result is his most honest and forthright music ever.</p>', '<p>Bon Iver has always been Justin Vernon’s escape route. After retreating to the woods of Wisconsin to record For Emma, Forever Ago, he drew a surrealist roadmap of the United States on Bon Iver, depicting a fantastical world where the lived, the dreamed, and desired coexisted. When this invented land felt oppressive and the anxiety of facing it too overwhelming, Vernon retreated again and burrowed within himself, pulverizing his voice with machines to create 22, A Million, a record that dramatized the fracturing of the self.</p><p>There’s no more hiding on i,i. Justin Vernon takes the Bon Iver sound and reassembles it like a cubist collage, with his voice right out front. All the familiar elements are here—impressionist swells of sound, impenetrable-yet-tender lyrics, mesmerizing studio tricks—and they are buoyed by Vernon’s supple baritone, the instrument he knows how to manipulate best. Acoustic guitar, horns, and piano return to prominence alongside the jittery electronics and synths that Vernon has lately favored. But the mood he conjures with these elements feels new. These songs don’t swallow you whole with grandeur; they look outward, leaving some room for the rest of the world.</p><p>The lyrics find Vernon locating peace within the ordinary and everyday. “I like you/And that ain’t nothing new,” he sings simply on “iMi.” Later, on “RABi,” he observes, “Well, it’s all just scared of dying.” These things don’t always merit saying out loud, but Vernon seems to be singing them to rediscover their meaning, and the music feels equally straightforward and searching. Songs like “Marion” and “Holyfields,” are uncharacteristically unadorned, even compared to the For Emma and Blood Bank era, when Vernon was at least joined by his own echoes. Here, he sounds completely exposed.</p><p>Still, there are plenty of invited guests to provide cover, or at least offer their company. James Blake, Moses Sumney, and Wye Oak’s Jenn Wasner, among others, pop up throughout. Even Young Thug collaborator Wheezy has composing and production credits. Vernon sampled the voices of others on 22, A Million, but in that context they felt more like dolls he’d animated than human beings. The guests on i,i, meanwhile, are allowed to breathe. Bruce Hornsby might sing only one line on the single “U (Man Like),” but his presence is enlivening. It’s less lonely to have friends nearby.</p><p>WATCH</p><p>The One Song DāM-FunK Wishes He Wrote</p><p>Vernon himself sings with more texture and conviction than ever before. He’s shifted fully from vessel to commander, steering the music instead of seeping into it. A song like “Naeem” is filled with production flourishes—a soft backing choir, faint samples, the sort of military drums favored on Bon Iver’s “Perth”—yet it all serves to highlight the booming sound of Vernon’s voice, bellowing in his natural range. The lyrics to “Naeem” are dizzying and, at points, indecipherable (“I fall off a bass boat/And the concrete’s very slow”), but he isn’t hiding behind them. It’s more like Vernon is suggesting that only feeling can offer truth. On “Naeem,” he sings, “Tell them I’ll be passing on/Tell them we’re young mastodons,” dragging his words in the second line until you can almost hear him choking up. Like all the best moments in his catalog, it is inexplicably touching.</p><p>i,i is often about trying to reconnect with some idea of a true self, even as you move forward. Vernon writes of scars and things lost: “You were young when you were gave it,” he sings on “We,” a line that speaks to his ability to summon powerful elegiac feelings with a few simple words. “Hey, Ma,” immediately one of the best songs in the Bon Iver catalog, is rousing and explicitly sentimental. “Full time you talk your money up/While it’s living in a coal mine,” Vernon belts, but his voice is too earthy to sound hateful. Instead, it’s like he’s offering absolution, promising that something as simple as a call to your mom is enough to make up for avarice or bluster.</p><p>At first glance, the tracklist for i,i is as bewildering as the symbol-laden 22, A Million. Upon listening, though, you realize that many of these are probably mondegreens and homonyms, cheeky nods to how hard it is to understand Bon Iver’s lyrics. “Jelmore,” for instance, is a fragment of what it sounds like when Vernon sings, “Well angel morning sivanna.” And the title for the closing “RABi” comes from the couplet, “I could prophet/I could rob I, however.” There are plenty of interpretive possibilities available in those words, but none of them are as enticing as their sheer sound. The music is also not as mysterious as the songs’ monikers suggest. There’s an overwhelming calmness and pleasantness to i,i, and “RABi” is one of the most easygoing of the bunch. “Sunlight feels good now don’t it,” Vernon sings. There’s no great symbolism in the track, no yearning, no enveloping echoes. What emerges is a solace that has eluded Vernon on past Bon Iver releases. “I don’t have a leaving plan,” he sings, maybe because there’s nowhere else he needs to go.</p>', 'images/21.png', '', 4, 2, 4, '2024-03-03 14:38:13', '2024-03-06 13:38:13'),

[Talking Heads’] Chris and Tina [Weymouth] were huge supporters of us from the very beginning, as was Blondie’s Debbie Harry and Chris Stein.

(24, 'Lana Del Rey Forgives You (Yes, You)', '<p>She\'s one of the most influential songwriters of the 21st century—and also one of the most misunderstood. But there’s a fine (and radical) art to learning to let go.</p>', '<p>Lana Del Rey never intended to punch in for a quickie Waffle House shift. But after seven days of seeing the same faces during a visit to Florence, Alabama, and a July morning’s worth of shooting the shit with her brother and sister in the same plastic booth, the singer-songwriter found herself wearing the Southern chain’s familiar uniform: a polycotton, working-class blue button-up garnished with a name tag bearing the crudely stickered letters L-A-N-A.</p><p>“We were on our third hour, and the servers asked, ‘Do you guys want shirts?’ ” she says. “Hell yeah! We were thrilled.”</p><p>The resulting video didn’t last 10 seconds. But after the restaurant’s manager posted the clip to Facebook and a few fan selfies featuring Del Rey in uniform popped up on the usual platforms, a narrative took hold. Lana Del Rey, Grammy-nominated artist who has sold 12.3 million albums, was working at Waffle House. Music blogs, morning news shows and food magazines all attempted to assign meaning to the bread crumbs — music video? writing expedition? career pivot? — for the better part of a week. In reality, she just has family ties to the small town, makes friends easily and, like anybody with a predilection for breakfast food or Americana, knows that a diner is a great place to kill time.</p><p>Listening to her laugh about this two months later, it’s not clear whether Del Rey is more amused by the memory of the experience or the fuss made in its wake. Either way, she happily fills in the gaps: “This guy, a regular, comes in every day and orders two things, so they were like, ‘Just go get it for him!’ I brought him a Coke. No ice. And an empty cup. </p><p>“For dip,” she clarifies, miming a spit of chewing tobacco over a Coke of her own (this one a Diet). “I didn’t see anyone take a video of me.”</p><p>Del Rey (born Elizabeth Grant) has had a strong hand in cultivating her own mythology since her 2012 major label debut, Born to Die, an album that divided critics at the time with its melancholia and just logged a historic 500th week on the Billboard 200. But The Waffle House Affair demonstrates how the 38-year-old’s story is just as often commandeered by social media, the press and her fans — a particularly zealous crowd that analyzes stray photos as exhaustively as her song lyrics. “The secret to Lana is that she’s exactly who she is,” says Jack Antonoff, who has produced three of her albums. “She’s really one of the greatest songwriters and vocalists who also likes to roll around in her truck and drink gas-station coffee. That can disarm people, but there’s no bit.”</p><p>Her deep text — she’s released nine albums and one book of poetry — also has earned Del Rey some high-profile admirers. Bruce Springsteen called her one of the greatest American songwriters. Billie Eilish credits her with changing music for women. Elton John compared her to Prince. And 20-year-old pop juggernaut Olivia Rodrigo pays homage to Del Rey lyrics on her chart-topping sophomore effort. “Lana’s work taught me how effective sentimentality can be in songwriting,” says Rodrigo. “She defies any stereotypes of what a woman writing pop songs should or shouldn’t be. She’s constantly pushing boundaries and making work that is fresh, adventurous and unabashedly feminine.”</p><p>If her peers turned on to her early, wider recognition took a while longer. After near-instant commercial success, the native New Yorker turned Angeleno finally tipped the critical scales with Norman Fucking Rockwell! in 2019. Debates over authenticity and performative ennui seemed to subside with her swirling 68-minute opus  — as much a lamentation of failed romance as it is of failed American dreams, fires engulfing the California coast on the album’s cover. With the country’s deep divisions laid bare by Trumpism and then the pandemic, Del Rey’s disillusionment suddenly made sense. Three subsequent efforts followed in short order. She’s touring her latest, the March release Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, with a string of U.S. dates this fall.</p><p>During a September interview that took place well after midnight in a guest house at the back of a friend’s Hollywood Hills property, Diet Coke in one hand and a turquoise vape in the other, Del Rey spoke about the long road to acceptance, her refusal to publish her lyrics and why, nearly 12 years after a maligned Saturday Night Live appearance, she’d consider performing on TV again.</p><p><span>Are you still surprised when something as innocuous as a few photos at Waffle House generates so much attention?</span></p><p>I wish my album had gone as viral. I woke up to, like, 10,000 texts the next morning — some from folks I had not heard from for 10 years. “Saw your picture at the Waffle House!” (Laughing.) I was like, “Did you hear the new album?”</p><p><span>You’ve released four LPs over the past four years. When you’re writing and recording, how quickly do you know what you’re working on is an album?</span></p><p>If it’s good, right away — once you get your four songs that you love the most. If it’s a struggle, it can go quickly, too. Music is kind of like a little blackbird on my shoulder, always pecking at me — even when I’m not interested in making music. And I really am genuinely interested in doing other things. Music is just relentless.</p><p>How do you engage with the release? Do you read reviews? </p><p>Previously? Not at all. (Laughs.) I did for this one. </p><p>Do you feel like more people get you now? </p><p>Yeah. Maybe they weren’t supposed to back in the day, when I thought that they would. There might’ve been a reason for that.</p><p>Might that reason be, at least in part, the world catching up to you? Your music explored some darker themes about American life before that outlook became more of a shared experience in recent years. </p><p>One hundred percent. I also feel, maybe spiritually, there was something I needed to learn from having people be so adamantly and vocally against it. There was room for me to look at why. It’s possible there are some things I might not have delved into [in my music] had I not heard the same critical throughline over and over and over again. Possibly, there was a bigger-picture reason for that. I wish it had not lasted for 10 years. That would’ve been helpful. But we’re in a good place now.</p><p>I’m trying to find the right term for how you were often regarded earlier in your career …</p><p>A loser? (Laughs.) </p><p>No, I was thinking of lightning rod. </p><p>Yeah, but you know what I’m saying. You do.</p><p>Whatever the word, you seem to have gone from one extreme to another with critics. Did you ever sense an in-between? </p><p>No. There was no in-between. I give credit to Jack Antonoff. I think that his production style has such an intelligence to it that vocals have a better chance of being read correctly. There’s a little more room to process it. It was that record [Norman Fucking Rockwell!] where all of a sudden things were really different. </p><p>Production obviously matters a great deal, but the praise is largely focused on your writing. The label “Great American Songwriter” is thrown around pretty frequently in descriptions of you. </p><p>Yeah, I’m reading it! (Laughs.) I like the title. I’ll take it. My whole life, I would’ve settled for Lynchian. “She’s Lynchian,” or, “She’s a little to the left,” or, “We love seeing her play at Largo.” I would have loved just that. But things continue to go well. I can relax a little bit now.</p><p>Do you ever look at or engage with platforms like Genius, where your lyrics are reprinted and interpreted? </p><p>I don’t. And I’ve never corrected anything. In fact, not for years have I actually submitted my lyrics to anybody. Should they be out there, they’re not from me. I would never. Good God! I don’t even want to think about what I have to say. </p><p>A few years back, you said that you started editing yourself because your lyrics were too personal. Are you still doing that?</p><p>Only in the past two months! I’ve never had someone make comments on my lyrics before, and then I recently met up with another writer. It’s a little bit of a different process now. For Tunnel, I did not edit myself. </p><p>Earlier in your career, you had a lot of invasions of privacy — a home intrusion, car thefts, a hack. Has that cooled down for you? </p><p>No. My records get [leaked] five months before they come out. They have for 11 years. I really don’t understand. I’ve gone to every great length to double check everything, but the songs come out. Even if I don’t [digitally] have them. I don’t like it. This is a lot of work. You want things to go well for the album.</p><p>When the time comes to tour, if you haven’t performed for a while, are you excited or nervous? </p><p>I get nervous. [But] this is a totally different tour. The stage production is bigger. There are more people on that stage with me, so I’m more comfortable. But even if it was just a one-off show and it was just me in the spotlight, I’d be much more equipped now. I have experience. I’ve toured just off of YouTube [music] since before I had an album. But right now, I’m excited. I don’t feel nervous to tour. </p><p>Most artists make the rounds when promoting an album, but you’ve done just one TV performance, The Tonight Show, since 2012, when you only played SNL [where she was derided for being vocally uneven] and David Letterman. I’d imagine there are offers. </p><p>They’re there. (Laughs.) I think I’ve done two [TV performances]? Maybe that’s something else I’ll grow into more, like touring. And don’t get me wrong. I toured for nine years of my life. It was nonstop. It was tough. But you know in your heart when it’s the right time. And it’s never been the right time. Maybe now, even if I didn’t feel confident, I would do it anyway. But there was a reason not to feel confident. </p><p>What was the reason? </p><p>I didn’t know if it would be received well. But there’s a lot of weirdos out there now, so, we’re fine. We’re in good company. I started at a time when things were very much one way. Little by little, there’s a lot more room for storytelling and saying different stuff. You’re seeing a lot more good girl songwriters, too. Well, who am I to say that? I like a lot of the singers out right now. </p><p>Many artists just one generation behind you, like Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo, have credited you as inspiration. How do you digest that? </p><p>Because Billie and Olivia are such good people, it’s fucking awesome. I love them and their music. It’s not like you have to be nice to be good [in music]. But, if you happen to be nice and a great singer, it makes me happy for the culture. I always had girls telling me [things like] that. Maybe not the critics or anybody else — but singers I knew, no matter how big or small, would write me letters. I always felt like the older sister to pretty much everyone I ever met.</p><p>Are you still thinking about doing a cover album?</p><p>Yeah, I want to. I’ve collected my cover songs for seven years. And I’ve said so much that I wanted to say, so it’s an awesome time to think about that. The standards. </p><p>If music is a nagging bird on your shoulder, what’s it keeping you from doing? </p><p>I have a lot of interests. I’d like working in other fields to the best of my ability. </p><p>Does other fields mean acting or, like, engineering? </p><p>Oh, no. Neither! It’s not necessarily creative. I’m somewhere in the middle, I would say. I’d just like something grounding, where your time is orderly. I think that’s really important because I have a lot of days on the fly. </p><p>Stevie Nicks said you should be a director.</p><p>Of films? I would be very bossy. </p><p>You recently recorded with your father, Rob Grant, who released his first major label album at 69. What was that like? </p><p>It was just sweet. He’s a funny guy. Deep sea fishing still takes up the majority of his time, but he makes a lot of music now. He’s riffing. I think music has made him happy. </p><p>What makes you happy?</p><p>Everything! I like getting all the props together [for projects]. I bought this fucking couch for this photo shoot. It’s fire. I like getting a bagel, down at Western Bagel, with a hot coffee and just sitting on the street — checking in with myself. If nothing’s going wrong, I feel great. At this point, I’m really happy. </p><p>Does it bother you when people still assign this “Sad Girl” identity on you, which sort of took hold with that track off of Ultraviolence?</p><p>No. I’m sad, too. And I’m so in touch with that. There was a lot to be sad about [back then]. What’s funny to me is that there wasn’t as much room for me to write about that as other people who did. By the grace of God, things have cooled down a little. But it’s been challenging for sure. </p><p>In reading a lot of old articles about you, both with or without your participation, you seemed to have a lot of ideas projected onto you without a lot of room to respond. Was that your experience? </p><p>That made there be no room. I wonder if that’s why I’m allowed to have my moment. But I’ve heard some good stories about some of the writers that I did not like. One of them ran up their company card on prostitutes. I love that. It just goes to show you that it’s not personal. Sometimes, the things you read, there’s a little bit of projection there. That’s the only guy who I’ve ever remembered his full name, but I’m not going to say it.</p><p>Has anyone who was part of that pile-on since apologized to you?</p><p>No. And I don’t think people speak about others in the same way they did back in 2011. The thing that I always thought was fucking stupid is that you learn more about somebody when you just let them talk. I never really felt like anyone was in it for the info. And talking about this [now] is appropriate because it is a huge part of [my] story. And new people who I meet have no idea. I’ll meet someone and they’ll think I’ve always been popular. (Laughs.) I have to correct them.</p><p>As a fan of Old Hollywood, what are your thoughts on the Marilyn Monroe house potentially being up for demolition? </p><p>Helena Drive. (Sighs.) I love that house. It’s historic. </p><p>You dressed like her twice this year — in the “Candy Necklace” video and at a concert in Brazil. Any reason behind the timing of the homage? </p><p>Oh, it’s every year. Well, there is a very specific impulse. I don’t think I would say it, though. From when I was younger, seeing her in pictures and movies, I just got that she was sweet. And she could be fucking funny. It’s just like, that’s my girl. But I guess everyone who likes that kind of thing probably feels that. She might have, you know, the most recognizable face — third to Jesus and who else? </p><p>Maybe the Mona Lisa.</p><p>Yeah, a painting! (Laughs.) She’s ever present. I wonder if she knew she would have been. I have a feeling she did.</p><p>Creatively, do you see yourself on a course right now? </p><p>The music took a huge turn from Norman, and it’s been going down that path aggressively. I’m going to continue going where I feel the only next stop is, but I think it’ll be in an Americana vein. The hard thing, in your personal life or in public, is that you can lose the idea that passion should be your true North. And, instead, safety should be. That’s the biggest pitfall. Being scared into making safe choices. Having a little bit of a cool-off period from the heat that might have been in a bad way, I got to reevaluate things. When there’s a little space, you get to choose. Then things get good.</p><p>I’m glad to hear things are good. </p><p>They are. You never have any idea how things are going to turn out, and I’ve recently had this clear feeling that I’m not supposed to know — as much as I’d like to see the next step on the staircase. I want to do so much, but there’s just so many left turns an individual can take … and I appear to like to learn the hard way. (Laughs.) Also, the world has an interesting sense of humor. So, what to do they say? To be determined. TBD.</p>', 'images/24.png', '', 11, 4, 3, '2024-02-21 14:50:42', '2024-02-22 14:50:42'),
(25, 'Thundercat Links Up With ‘Long Lost Bandmate’ Tame Impala on New Song ‘No More Lies’', '<p>The bassist discusses his new single and dream collaboration with Kevin Parker with Rolling Stone: \"I knew we wouldn\'t steer each other wrong\"</p>', '<p>From the moment he first heard Tame Impala, Thundercat felt a profound sense of connection to Kevin Parker — which made his desire to work with the Australian psych whiz more of a need than a want. “There’s a part of me that felt like we’d be in a band together,” the bassist and songwriter tells Rolling Stone with a laugh, adding: “Even if we weren’t in a band together, it just felt like we were definitely long lost bandmates from another era.” </p><p>Now, Thundercat (real name Stephen Bruner) has finally realized that dream on his new song with Parker, “No More Lies.” The two artists’ distinct styles blend perfectly on the song — bustling, groovy, slightly wonky funk tinged with just the right psychedelic touches — as Bruner and Parker split vocal duties and mediate on an ill-fated relationship with humor and hard-edged candor.</p><p>Bruner says he fell in love with Tame Impala the first time he heard “Apocalypse Dreams” off 2012’s Lonerism. Noting the thematic synchronicity with the 2013 Thundercat album Apocalypse, Bruner says that song was a balm as he grappled with the grief following the death of his friend, jazz pianist Austin Peralta. </p><p>“I was in my 20s, and there were a lot of things in and around the feelings that came with that moment,” he says. “I remember hearing that [song], and the line, as soon as he said, ‘Everything is changing,’ I felt that in my spirit. It spoke to me. It felt so wild and shape-shifting, emotionally.” </p><p>The excitement was palpable when the musicians finally met and started working together. In classic fashion, Bruner cracks, “I almost peed on myself.” But he also remembers how important it was to tell Parker, “When I say I’m a fan of your music, I mean it. Your music held me together.” </p><p>From there, the pair quickly started creating. Parker brought in the rough idea for “No More Lies,” Bruner immediately added a bass line, and the rest of the song flowed naturally from there. Bruner took the lead on vocals and lyrics — “The concept kind of came up like vomit, to be honest,” he says — but every element of the track was a collaborative effort.</p><p>“There’s only a couple of people I’ve written lyrics with, and I invited it because I wanted to embrace whatever was to come of what we would create,” Bruner says. “I felt like I knew we wouldn’t steer each other wrong. There’s a lot of trust. Even feeling comfortable enough to sing in front of somebody that you look up to, or somebody that you don’t want to embarrass yourself in front of. But I didn’t hold back.”</p><p>At the heart of “No More Lies” is a monolog from Bruner, in which he tries to parse the Catch-22 of how you can hurt a partner with a lie as much as the truth. It’s a universal anxiety, but Bruner ends with a perfect one-liner that gives the issue a hyper-local twist: “If it seems like I don’t care, it doesn’t mean I don’t care — it just looks like I don’t care, because my emotions have been sanded off.” Then, with a self-conscious chuckle, “I live in L.A., sweetie, what do you expect!”</p><p>Of that particular Los Angeles condition, Bruner (who’s spent his whole life in the city) says, “Everybody has dreams, everybody’s a star, everybody’s expendable, everything is expendable, everything is too expensive. It’s embedded in our culture. Even though there are other places than Hollywood, it’s still Hollywood. ‘There’s no such thing as bad publicity’ — where else would you hear that? You wouldn’t hear that in Wisconsin.”</p><p>With a laugh, he adds, “I feel like Walter in The Big Lebowski: ‘Am I wrong here? Am I wrong?!’ Well, you’re not wrong — you’re just an asshole.”</p><p>“No More Lies” is the first proper single Thundercat has released in three years since his 2020 album, It Is What It Is. He’s stayed busy since then and without giving too much away, says there’s “absolutely” more music — and a new album — on the horizon. “No More Lies,” though, offers a glimpse at where he’s at creatively and how he’s been trying to approach his work at this juncture.</p><p>“I’ve just been trying to be very open to how things show up creatively with me, and I feel like this is one of those moments that is showing itself as the difference,” he says. Of the other music he’s working on, he adds, “I’m open to many different, new things. I’m excited, but in a different manner — charting unknown territory, so to speak.”</p>', 'images/25.png', '', 6, 5, 6, '2024-03-05 14:53:52', '2024-03-05 13:53:52'),
(26, 'Why we can’t afford to lose holiday camp festival weekenders like Mighty Hoopla', '<p>Soaring costs have challenged the viability of successful holiday camp festivals held at Butlin\'s and Pontins. NME heads to Bognor Regis to see what the music world will be missing out on</p>', '<p>While your typical English music festivals tend to show landmark sporting occasions on big screens after requests from fans, the Mighty Hoopla Big Weekender is worlds apart from your standard cider-chugging muddy field. The event – which takes place at Butlin’s in Bognor Regis – had its own unmissable TV moment.</p><p>NME is at the British holiday park for a weekend of music, fun, campness and community. But first, on the opening Friday night, it’s time for the finale of BBC’s hit reality TV show The Traitors… but only after a personal message from cult hero of the moment, Queen Diane. With a Winkleman of Claudias stalking the room in the host’s trademark fingerless gloves, dark eye make-up and roll-neck jumpers, it’s clear that everyone who has descended on West Sussex’s seaside town Bognor Regis is living for the drama. As Hunsnet enthused on socials, the deafening reaction to the big reveal “was like the World Cup for Huns”.</p><p>This introduction to a proudly unique weekend is indicative of the type of event that Mighty Hoopla has been since its arrival in 2016: its an all-embracing celebration of pop music icons and queer culture. “As with everything we’ve done, it was born from the idea of building a space that doesn’t exist,” reflects co-founder Jamie Tagg when NME catches up with him on-site.</p><p>Since the Mighty Hoopla family first made Bognor their home, and with the addition of a sparkling London festival in 2017, the festival has become one of the UK’s most original and beloved events. While this summer’s two-dayer in Brockwell Park in south London will welcome Jessie Ware, Kim Petras and Nelly Furtado, 2024’s Big Weekender sadly marks the crew’s final pilgrimage to Butlin’s. Its future elsewhere is yet to be confirmed, but it marks the latest worrying sign for British events.</p><p>“We’ve had such a beautiful run, and we’re not closing the door, but there’s other things we could do that the crowd could enjoy more for the price,” co-founder Glyn Fussell says. They cite the impact of rising travel and booking costs as to why they’re leaving Butlin’s. “It can cost more to bring an artist to Bognor than London because of where it is, and we don’t want to pass that cost onto the customer.”</p><p>The loss is the latest blow to the country’s cultural offering, with venues already on the ropes and similar seaside resort events across the country under threat. Legendary hardcore rave-up Bangface is being forced to relocate following the closure of its home at Pontins in Southport.</p><p>While there are other successful Butlin’s weekenders – Rockaway Beach brought Sleaford Mods, Bob Vylan and Dream Wife to Bognor in early January, and Fatboy Slim’s All Back To Minehead caters to dance and rave fans specifically – neither have built such a strong cult fanbase as Mighty Hoopla.</p><p>Its popularity will come as little surprise: Tagg and co-founder Glyn Fussell were also the brains behind drag heroes Sink the Pink and club nights Rebel Bingo and Guilty Pleasures. Initially, the groups toured the UK festival circuit together in the early 2010s.</p><p>“The first thing everyone would ask each other at check-in would be ‘what shit stage are you on?’ because the organisers didn’t know what to do with us,” Tagg recalls. “We were giving our magic to other festivals,” Fussell adds. Worse still, Fussell remembers incidents of drag performers he had booked being booed off festival stages. “They came out with fans and the lads were so challenged by their own sexuality,” he says. “It was heartbreaking because I had to tell them ‘we’re not welcome here.’”</p><p>This lack of acceptance led to Tagg and Fussell deciding to create a festival of their own that they could control. In 2016 the Mighty Hoopla Big Weekender was born, resulting in a collective community forming. While a Sink The Pink crowd turned up (many with passports as they had no clue where Bognor was), the Butlin’s team also invited some of their regulars. “When they met, we were like ‘what have we done?’ It was like two tribes looking at each other and, within minutes, it was a party,” Fussell says. “We felt like geniuses: going from sheer fear to joy.”</p><p>The seaside resort has been the go-to place for British families to have affordably-priced, fun-filled holidays since 1936. For decades, its child-friendly entertainment programme has seen Redcoat performers take to the stage, while more recently it has hosted magic shows from TV presenter Stephen Mulhern.</p><p>“It’s reclaiming spaces that you don’t feel were suitable or fitted you and your community when you were younger,” Fussell says. “As a working class little gay boy, I would have never felt comfortable coming here and going to Splashworld [the site’s water park], or even just walking around a Butlin’s. Much in the way that I was raised in working men’s clubs and never felt comfortable in them. It’s about rewriting the narrative, but with lots of camp bells and whistles”.</p><p>While Fussell feels it’s important that queer events are for queer people, with Mighty Hoopla they also wanted to “break the barrier and start recruiting allies. People who come here may not have been to an LGBTQIA+ event but think it’s really fun and want to protect it and be a part of it.”</p><p>The Bristolian comedian Jayde Adams feels similarly. “I played a Madness weekender [at Butlin’s] and I was booed off the stage”, she recalls. Returning to Butlin’s, this time at Mighty Hoopla Big Weekender, three years in the trot “healed her”. Fussell now describes Adams as “part of the furniture”.</p><p>What is it that keeps Adams coming back, though? “When you’ve got something slightly different about you and you’re othered throughout your life, when you can get together with a bunch of other people that have been othered, you don’t feel so othered anymore,” she says. “You feel like you’ve got a community, and this just strengthens confidence,” she adds. “You’ve got like-minded souls together in a big space. Gays just want to be safe in their own space and this is what that provides.

(27, 'Lana Del Rey- Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd', '<p>The singer-songwriter’s ninth album arrives as a sweeping, sterling, often confounding work of self-mythology and psychoamericana: Lana’s in the zone.</p>', '<p>In 2014, Lana Del Rey told a journalist that she wished she was dead, and for what seemed like years after, scarcely an article was written about her that didn’t mention it. Back then, the singer was still miserable at the sour critical reception of her debut album. She was, perhaps, peddling its underlying fatalism, pushing back on allegations that her noirish Born to Die persona was fabricated. Almost certainly, she was harboring the sort of creative ambition that craved association with tragic geniuses like Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse.</p><p>Lana has lived many days since then and seemingly found some of them worthwhile. In due course, particularly since the release of her 2019 national pulse check Norman Fucking Rockwell!, her songwriting received the recognition she always knew it deserved. In conversation with Rolling Stone this month, Lana described a great unburdening in her psychic space. She is still talking—and singing—about death. But now, rather than an escape hatch, it’s a framing device through which to peer at her life. “The Grants,” which opens her ninth studio album, climbs to the metaphorical mountaintop, guided by John Denver’s sense of mystical wonderment, to receive wisdom from on high. “My pastor told me when you leave all you take is your memory,” goes the chorus, resolute like a hymn, wrapped up with gospel backing vocals and orchestral ribbons, “And I’m gonna take mine of you with me.” To whittle the raw material of life into meaning, worth preserving—this is the writer’s task.</p><p>It’s one that Lana takes up vigorously, even if that meaning is sometimes legible only to her. Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd arrives as a sweeping, confounding work-in-process. It’s full of quiet ruminations and loud interruptions; of visible seams and unhemmed edges, from the choir rehearsal that runs through its opening moments to the sound of the piano’s sustain pedal releasing at its end. Beauty—long Lana’s virtue and her burden—fades or is forgotten, like that titular tunnel, its mosaic ceilings and painted tiles sealed up and abandoned. Here, Lana is after something more enduring, the matters “at the very heart of things”: family, love, healing, art, legacy, wisdom—and all the contradictions and consternation that come along with the pursuit.</p><p>Blue Banisters, Lana’s album from 2021, introduced many of the ideas that stand out here: revisiting old material with new relish, releasing pop’s conventional structures and polish, writing about loved ones with tender specificity. Lana, née Elizabeth Grant, opens Ocean Blvd with a track that bears her family name, and she holds her father, brother, and sister close throughout, as if bracing for loss. On one song, she exhales a prayer amid jazzy squiggles, calling on her grandfather’s spirit to protect her father, a maritime enthusiast, while he’s deep-sea fishing. She entreats her brother Charlie to quit smoking. The matter of bearing children—her sister’s daughter and Lana’s own hypothetical offspring—comes up repeatedly, on “The Grants” and “Sweet,” a tradwife fantasy tucked in a mid-century movie-musical score. “Fingertips” broaches the topic of motherhood with a devastating admission of self-doubt: “Will the baby be all right/Will I have one of mine?/Can I handle it even if I do?”</p><p>Such a sentiment could easily be extrapolated into a comment on millennial unease, but this feels more personal. It’s Lana, a self-made emblem of vulnerable womanhood—in her own words, “a modern-day woman with a weak constitution”—at her most genuinely unguarded. She was nervous to send early sketches to producer Drew Erickson, she said, and even in finished form, the material sounds like it’s for her ears only. With its solemn hush, meticulously rendered but opaque details, and lack of organizing logic, “Fingertips” seems disinterested in holding our attention. There’s no rhythm, no structure, only the strings and the Wurlitzer picking up Lana’s breadcrumbs as she wanders the misty forest of her own memory.</p><p>Elsewhere, Lana throws stones into these still waters, most memorably on “A&W.” She writes from the perspective of the other woman, a familiar figure in her discography—sometimes, a sympathetic lonely heart; here, a symbol of the ire that unorthodox women unleash. “Did you know that a singer can still be looking like a side piece at 33?” asks Lana—unmarried and child-free at 37, a subject of constant physical scrutiny. The title is a fit-to-print stand-in for “American Whore,” and Lana cycles through her many avatars: an embattled attention-seeker, an illicit lover, an imperfect victim (“Do you really think that anybody would think I didn’t ask for it?”). Then, after a radical about-face that steers the song from voice-memo balladry into boom-bap playground rap, she is someone else entirely: a girlish brat tattling to someone’s mom. A critic, albeit a clumsy one, of empowerment feminism, Lana here embodies characters that point to just how little girlbossing has done to remedy societal malice toward women. They reflect an enduring taxonomy, reified in a post-Roe landscape: We are whores who deserve what we get, or else children to be saved from our own decisions.</p><p>Where do we go from here? To church, apparently. Lana follows “A&W” with a sermon on lust from Judah Smith, the Beverly Hills pastor and influencer who counts the Biebers (and Lana too) among his congregants. The four-and-a-half-minute homily, accompanied by melancholy piano, is presented with little comment beyond an occasional laugh or affirmation, possibly from Lana herself; given its placement, the track seems designed more to inflame than to enlighten. At the end, though, comes an interesting kernel: “I used to think my preaching was mostly about you,” Smith concedes, “...I’ve discovered that my preaching is mostly about me.”</p><p>Now more than ever, Lana’s preaching is mostly about her, reflecting a growing instinct to self-mythologize. On Ocean Blvd, she sings explicitly about being Lana Del Rey, with lyrics like “Some big man behind the scenes/Sewing Frankenstein black dreams into my song” pointing all the way back to the industry-plant allegations that surfaced around the time of her debut. That backward-looking gaze also settles on hip-hop, a longstanding presence in her work that was substantially dialed down after 2017’s Lust for Life. The trap beats are back, at least in the record’s final stretch, where they accompany some of Lana’s most willful provocations. Her lyrics flirt with transgressions that have previously landed her in hot water, within and beyond her music: casual Covid noncompliance, brownface. There’s a sense of doubling down, of insistence that her path is hers alone to forge. On “Taco Truck x VB,” the chimeric closer that is partially a trap remix of Norman Fucking Rockwell!’s “Venice Bitch,” Lana elbows her way in front of the criticism: “Before you talk let me stop what you say/I know, I know, I know that you hate me.” She is fresher yet out of fucks.</p><p>Lana is a postmodern collagist and a chronic cataloguer of her references: Take “Peppers,” which samples Tommy Genesis’ ribald 2015 track “Angelina,” name-checks the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and interpolates a surf-rock classic, all in the span of four minutes. At her best, Lana reinterprets others’ work with intention, percolating their meaning through a personal filter. The way that she now applies this same approach to her own past material—beyond the “Venice Bitch” remake, there’s a sliver of “Cinnamon Girl” in the Jon Batiste feature “Candy Necklace,” and chopped-up strings from “Norman Fucking Rockwell” on “A&W”—suggests an artist who is tracing her own evolution and also submitting her work, ripe for reimagining, for entry in the greater American songbook from which she so readily draws.</p><p>One of Ocean Blvd’s key takeaways is that perfection is not a requirement for inclusion in this canon. Part of the title track is spent extolling a sublime flaw—a specific beat in the 1974 Harry Nilsson song “Don’t Forget Me.” Lana cites, by timestamp (2:05), the moment when the singer-songwriter’s voice breaks, cracking open the track with raw emotion. As an indicator of Lana’s mindset, this embrace of imperfection may help explain some of Ocean Blvd’s excesses and experiments, which nobly pursue profundity and succeed only sometimes. Still, there are 2:05s to be found within the sprawl.</p>', 'images/27.png', '', 1, 2, 1, '2024-03-03 15:01:13', '2024-03-03 16:01:13'),

This week: Fred Schneider of The B-52s takes the ultimate test!</p>', '<p>“Was it a dead guy from George A. Romero’s Night of the Living Dead?”</p><p>WRONG. It’s Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. ‘Santa’s Disco’ is off The Superions’ album ‘Destination…Christmas!’…</p><p>“I like weird holiday albums. I’m sick of ‘Jingle Bell Rock’ and ‘Ave Maria’, and prefer the Barking Dogs doing ‘Jingle Bells’ and [Gayla Peevey’s] ‘I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas’. So I always wanted to do a Christmas album and since no one has ever done a song about fruitcake – and I’m probably one of three people in the world who likes fruitcake – voila, we recorded [the track] ‘Fruitcake’! I hardly mention Christmas in my songs and I don’t mention JC.”</p><p>On the subject of horror, you used to film your own movies before you started the B-52s…</p><p>“We’re doing a B-52s documentary and they might show bits of one 8mm horror movie I did – it was more like a horrible movie! – called The Day After the Night of the Living Dead, which starred one of my brothers and two of my sisters, and was filmed in a cemetery next to my friend’s house. It’s six minutes long and is my brother and his friends just popping up from behind tombstones and attacking us while we’re having a barbecue [Laughs].”</p><p>Was there a moment when you realised that The B-52s music had entered the mainstream?</p><p>“That came with [1989’s] ‘Love Shack’, which I had to beg radio stations to play because they wouldn’t touch it and thought it was too weird – but I’m glad they did in the end. It saved us financially and then the next single ‘Roam’ charted at Number 3 [in the US] as well. But it was just a happy accident that ‘Love Shack’ finally became a hit, and now you have to go to every damn wedding and hear it! Whenever I hear a bad version of ‘Love Shack’ being performed, I’ll say: ‘Look, do you mind if I sing it?’ If someone’s ruining the song on karaoke, I’ll get up there! The singer is in shock – but everyone else appreciates it because the other person stank.”</p><p>In his 2020 autobiography ‘Remain In Love’, Talking Heads drummer Chris Frantz claims that when you first sent The B-52s’ iconic 1979 single ‘Rock Lobster’ to New York club CGBG, their response was negative, which made him want to march down there and “kick their asses”…</p><p>“He probably would have! [Talking Heads’] Chris and Tina [Weymouth] were huge supporters of us from the very beginning, as was Blondie’s Debbie Harry and Chris Stein. CGBG was a punk club and no one had a sense of humour until we came along. We were tongue-in-cheek. We weren’t ‘camp’, which is a label we keep getting. We weren’t telling music as jokes, although I must admit some of our songs are weird! Like ‘Rock Lobster’! People even dressed up as lobsters at our gigs – now they just wear big wigs and block peoples’ views.”</p><p>Talking Heads’ member David Byrne produced The B-52s 1982 EP ‘Mesopotamia‘. How did you find working with him – didn’t you once accuse him of stealing your ideas?</p><p>“He did a really good job. I only went in for the two songs I was on. And he did use lyrics that Ricky had written on two of his songs. Don’t share original ideas with him!”</p><p>“[Fred starts singing ’52 Girls’] ‘Effie, Madge and Mabel/Biddie, see them on the beach, Or in New York City/Tina Louise/And there’s Hazel and Mavis/Can you name, name, name’…So how many was that? Eight so far? I guess 18 then?</p><p>“I thought it was a just a limited edition single of a couple of thousand records?”</p><p>WRONG. It also appears as a B-side on their 2003 single ‘Times Like These‘.</p><p>“I wish they’d told me. I’d have bought a bunch! [Laughs] I was excited to do it and thought it turned out good.”</p><p>As suburban kids, Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl had their minds opened after watching The B-52s on Saturday Night Live…</p><p>“Well, tell that to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame! [Laughs].”</p><p>Did you know that SNL performance would be such a lightning-rod moment?</p><p>“No. We were paralysed by fear. That’s why we looked so serious, ‘cause we were nervous as hell and we weren’t camera-ready like most kids today. Kate [Pierson, B-52s member]’s keyboard was vintage, and we had to fix it every time we dragged it somewhere, and Ricky broke strings all the time back then, so we were afraid something would go wrong.”</p><p>Who’s been the most unexpected fan of The B-52s?</p><p>“David Bowie came to one our shows before we signed.

(29, 'Yeat -2093', '<p>New Yeat’s album or How Far Can Experiments Bring you</p>', '<p>The artist Yeat has already gone through different stages of artistry, from being a TikTok meme sound to the favorite artist of 14-year-olds. My first acquaintance with Yeat came from his 2022 album 2 Alivë, which left an underwhelming feeling within me. I wasn’t feeling his sound artistry, and especially his vocal delivery. The only thing that I heard and saw from him was his indistinctive mumbling and repetitive sound. Following the project as mentioned above, Yeat has put out two more, such as Lyfë and Aftërlyfe. Despite this, the still relevant repetitiveness and redundancy deduced some points from those projects. As a regular listener of Yeats, I have witnessed his creative evolution and noticed his more surreal approach to creating his albums. Although previous albums may have had some questionable material on them, this stage was necessary to develop something as grandeur, as 2093.</p><p>Yeat’s fourth studio album, 2093, goes into the lane that was partially tested on Aftërlyfe. When I first examined the project, my initial thoughts differed from the prejudices I had before. I expected to get bored by the third or fourth track, but I was wrong. Yeat has garnered my attention.</p><p>It feels like an enormous gap between the previous projects, and his latest effort 2093. Even Yeat himself has expressed a few words about this in 032 magazines:</p><p>Between the last record and this upcoming one, it feels like a ten-album difference in time. People have no idea what it’s going to sound like. It’s, like, 2093, a dystopian society</p><p>I think this description accurately depicts the true sound. The artwork of 2093 features a blurry green color image of the dystopian society the artist was talking about that adds more mystery to the project.</p><p>I am astonished by the production behind this album. It goes beyond the boundaries of psychedelic hip-hop because of a combination of aggressive synths and futuristic distinctive sound. Various amounts of unexpected turns in the soundscape make you engage in it, like in an epic 5-star blockbuster movie. All the darkness and aggressiveness that Yeat gives you work. You become immersed in the dark and violent world, and with his bombastic sound, it is certainly a fresh experience for me.</p><p>Look at Future, who effortlessly captures Yeat’s aggressive and hungry flow and plays his role in a song. Future’s flow is immaculate. In recent times, he has been less energetic in showcasing his talents, so it is cool to see him bring such performances.</p><p>The second feature guest who surprised me was Drake. Based on their recent collaboration “IDGAF”, which was clearly Yeat’s domination in a song, this time Drake puts greater effort. When I talk about a greater effort, I mean he truly delivered and seemed comfortable with the surreal beat, incorporating orchestral instruments into it. Lil Wayne, who is a third and final artist, also brings a good mix of energy to Yeat’s rage vocals on “Lyfëstyle”.</p><p>The reason it works so well is that it’s not overfilled with features. Yeat’s music is rather diverse here, and with different flows and atmospheres on each song, making it captivating to listen to. And with the addition of a unique artist on the album, it adds to the overall coherence and enhances the listening experience.</p><p>What I also believe is worth mentioning is that I think people will see a big relevance and a great replacement for Playboi Carti’s upcoming album MUSIC in this one. As we may see, he sounds more like Carti than the actual Carti in some songs, and based on the snippets that we heard from Playboi, I am standing on Yeat’s side. His project steps into electro-industrial hip-hop, rather than just the mumble trap sound with a raw voice.</p><p>The noticeable drawback of this project is the runtime. Discovering unusual sounds and listening to this thing is something I enjoy, but the album should not surpass 1 hour and 18 minutes for the deluxe version or 1 hour and 11 minutes for the regular version. It is still staying demanding to listen, although with a much bigger ‘use-gratification’ value than any of his earlier projects. There are certainly still some drawbacks to his sound, and sometimes, he may still sound somewhat repetitive, but this repetitiveness becomes instantly covered by the flow and tempo changes in the song.</p><p>I enjoy seeing artists who are passionate about their work, and Yeat embodies that spirit. He brings you fun and new experiences whilst fostering himself as an artist, and I respect that.</p><p>FINAL RATING: 7.2/10</p>', 'images/29.png', '', 12, 2, 11, '2024-02-08 15:04:05', '2024-02-09 15:04:05');

(30, 'Andrew Bird - My Finest Work Yet', '<p>fter a string of releases that sometimes felt like hearing Bird think himself in circles, the singer-songwriter relaxes into his most plainly and darkly funny album in a long time.</p>', '<p>Andrew Bird’s work the past decade has scrutinized on the link between sound and time. He made an acoustic album in a barn; he recorded an instrumental album at the bottom of a canyon, and then another while standing in a river; he toured for years with gigantic spinning gramophone horns; he turned a single song into a seven-track EP by treating it like a film score; he made an actual film score. Along the way, Bird’s image started drifting away from playful fiction-spinner and toward haggard philosopher: sometimes isolating and difficult to follow, always interesting. Around the time that he jolted into a 7/8 breakdown on a sprawling, sorrowful song about physically mutating from tour-life conditions called “Anonanimal,” the Andrew Bird who once promised snacks at the end of civilization was becoming a fading memory.</p><p>That irreverent, contentedly existential side of Bird makes a pleasantly surprising return on My Finest Work Yet, his most plainly and darkly funny album in a long time. While its cover art depicts Bird swapped into Jacques-Louis David’s “The Death of Marat,” its music is more Monty Python’s Life of Brian: consumed with human history and equally ready to poke fun at it. It sounds eerily informed by “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,” right down to its undermining of doom with whistling: “The Earth spins faster, whistles right past ya / Whispers death in your ear / Don’t pretend you can’t hear,” Bird casually drops on “Manifest,” just before offering another of his signature whistling solos. After a string of releases that sometimes felt like hearing Bird think himself in circles, the philosophy professor drops the chalk mid-proof, turns to the class, and cheerily concludes, “We’re all screwed!”</p><p>Even those who tend to tune out lyrics can recognize a reinstated directness in Bird’s composing, whether in the ambush of violins on“Manifest”, the straighforwardly beautiful ballad “Cracking Codes,” or the unrestrained “OH”s that hoist up “Olympians.” There are a few filler moments that would fit on any other Bird album—”Fallorun” in particular falls flat—but the rest feel like they share a common attitude of “Why not?”. “Don the Struggle” actually brings back the 7/8 dance breakdown, but this time to serve as a foil to the song’s “Benny and the Jets” stomp. The flip is as clear as Bird’s shrug when he repeats over and over, “We’re all just stumbling down / Through an unnamed struggling town.”</p><p>Bird knows how to deploy specificity so suddenly and casually that it tickles—and then how to complicate that reaction. Lines here about J. Edgar Hoover, the Spanish Civil War, and Sisyphus all feel more intended to incite chuckling than chin-stroking. On the latter, which is also the name of the opening track and lead single, he questions the condemned Greek king’s dilemma: “Did he raise both fists and say, ‘To hell with this,’ and just / Let the rock roll?” That image seems more than a little self-referential in light of Bird’s obsessive style of music-making. Here, he takes a moment to set that boulder down, throw his hands up, and grin at the beautiful futility of it all.</p>', 'images/30.png\r\n', '', 1, 2, 1, '2024-02-27 15:04:05', '2024-02-28 10:04:05'),
(31, 'Mitski - The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We', '<p>After contemplating retirement, Mitski returns with a new album that’s warmer, quieter, and more organic-sounding. For the first time in a while, she sounds like she has space to breathe.</p>', '<p>The tiny desert town of Valentine, Texas got its name after railroad workers laying tracks east from El Paso first reached it on February 14, 1882. Or maybe its namesake is John Valentine, the American expressman who supervised transit routes out west before becoming the inaugural president of Wells Fargo. Whichever the true origin story, it’s where Mitski gazed at her first dust devils on a trek across America—thinking about the whirling forces of love and commerce, how to insulate her passion for music from an extractive industry.</p><p>These heavy thoughts guided “Valentine, Texas,” a 2022 song off Laurel Hell on which Mitski cast her inner turmoil onto the natural world: observing clouds that resembled mountains, then visualizing those mountains drifting off, wishing for her burdens to dissipate like vapor. It introduced a chilly, fatalistic album that hinted at commercial pop ambition while anticipating the end of her career—a sense of doomed finality reinforced by its title, an Appalachian folk term for rhododendron thickets where wanderers die after getting stuck. But after Laurel Hell’s release, Mitski wrestled forward: “I renegotiated my contract with my label, and decided to keep making records,” she announced. Now “Valentine, Texas” appears like a guidepost along a long, winding road to the wide expanses of her seventh album, The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We.</p><p>Here, the alchemical imagination that turns cumuli into sierras meets fireflies that hurtle like cars and freight trains that clomp like wild cattle. Mitski conjures scenes of stark and spectral beauty, backed by sweeping orchestral arrangements written by Drew Erickson, the man behind the Old Hollywood grandeur of Father John Misty’s Chloë and the Next 20st Century and the cosmic bloom of Weyes Blood’s And in the Darkness, Hearts Aglow. Gone is the claustrophobic synth-pop that landed Mitski her first Billboard hit, the tense sound of the big city; now the blinding lights of the stage seem to appear only as a memory. The result is a warmer, quieter, and more organic-sounding record that foregrounds her evocative songwriting. For the first time in a while, she sounds like she has space to breathe.</p><p>As always with Mitski’s albums, loneliness is an inescapable feature of the geography: “It’s just witness-less me,” she sings to empty space on “The Frost,” realizing that she’s alone in her grief. Her steely, vigilant stance—so prevalent on 2018’s Be the Cowboy and Laurel Hell—has softened, the starch dissolving from her personality. So even when connection seems impossible, she reaches for company. She sends love to a benevolent moon, hoping it will pass on the sentiment after she fades to dust. She pours herself another glass, because “sometimes a drink feels like family”—and over solitary, minimal guitar strums, a chorus of voices swell up behind her like a cruel hallucination: “FAMILY.”</p><p>This wilderness might seem like a godless place, but Mitski finds scattered signs of divinity: in the body of a drowned insect contaminating the last sips of Jameson, a corpse that from a different vantage looks like an angel. Or the blind, nameless mutt who “shits where she’s supposed to” and embodies hope in breathing, primal form. Strange creatures prowl throughout The Land Is Inhospitable like deities, delivering flashes of frightening insight. An oracular bird mockingly reminds Mitski of her spiritual imprisonment on “The Deal” after she bargains away her soul: “Your pain is eased but you’ll never be free.” A pack of dogs executes a kind of Biblical punishment on “I’m Your Man,” yapping as cicadas chirp, a toad shrieks, and angels harmonize from above. “I’m sorry I’m the one you love,” Mitski laments to a partner, “I’ll meet judgment by the hounds.”</p><p>These are among some of the most surreal, existential, and fascinating songs of Mitski’s career, zooming out from the exigencies of her vocation to probe the essence of the human condition and our place in the cosmos. The album still offers portraits of routine suffering, like on “I Don’t Like My Mind,” on which Mitski plays a self-loathing workaholic who only rests on “an inconvenient Christmas,” gorging herself on cake only to vomit it back up. But the broader universe seeps into even the most mundane settings, intimate moments charged with otherworldly significance. “Heaven” is a tableaux of domestic bliss in which Mitski becomes one with the environment, comparing herself to murmuring brooks and bending willows as she luxuriates in private moments with her lover: “I sip on the rest of the coffee you left/A kiss left of you/Heaven, heaven, heaven.” The misty orchestral swirls at the song’s end make it feel like we too have ascended.</p><p>From up above, what do we see? Tiny individuals hubristically trying to make something of ourselves, to push ahead, while knowing that one day the culmination of all that effort will disappear. Evidence of alienation and brutality, but also of softness and beauty. On “Star,” Mitski sings an elegy to a lost love from the other side of isolation, using the galaxy as evidence of a greater hope. The land may be inhospitable, but pan out and you’ll recognize what she does—hardship and pleasure, the choice to embrace love, and the belief that in the end it will have been worth it.</p>', 'images/31.png', '', 2, 2, 2, '2024-01-31 15:08:08', '2024-02-01 15:08:08'),

As it blooms, this track shows how far Spring can go vocally. Bits of trumpet are added to the chorus, and they shine the most, even if they aren’t played through the whole song. Another track that caught my ear was “Didn’t You Say.” If you listen closely, you can hear the use of brass highlighting the jazz-influenced vibe as Spring pours his feelings adding the sweet old blues with his harmonious vocals. The steady and catchy strums of the guitar result in the sound of classic rock alongside the quick-cut percussions and drums. I don’t think you can put Holy Hive solely into either a soul or folk genre box. There always seems to be more behind their sound, and this track highlights it.</p><p>My heart felt as if it were sitting on the fluffiest pillows that were nothing but safe when listening to “Be Thou By My Side.” Spring’s soothing vocals are the icing to the track. His voice and the tone of the song come off as comforting. It’s a vulnerable piece and makes me want someone to be my lover as Spring croons, “So why’d you lie? / Tell me you’re ready / I’ll be home tonight / I’ll be your lover.”</p><p>When I first heard, “Oh I Miss Her So,” I couldn’t help but compare the flutter of the guitar strings to the flutter of butterfly wings. The ironic thing is that the lyrics seem to match this feeling: “And she wants to fly away / To a bluer sky and sunny day / Oh I miss her so.” The transition into brass and what sounds like a harp near the middle of the track is pure elegance. It’s an alluring piece that Holy Hive incorporated beautifully into the track.</p><p>As we get closer to the end of the album, Holy Hive manages to change it up with “Cynthia’s Celebration,” the only instrumental track in its delicacy. This track shows that Holy Hive has a strong foundation when it comes to playing their instruments, as it is just as intriguing as the rest of the album. “Red is The Rose” has Spring come in with a bit of a stronger tone. You can catch a hint of some psychedelia accompanied by the sound of soft percussion heard here and there. I think this shows how modern Holy Hive is, yet how classic they can sound. This song could be released in a different musical era—such as the ’60s/’70s—and it would do great.</p><p>I found the last track, “Sophia’s Part,” to be a hauntingly beautiful song, though there’s ultimately nothing to be afraid of. There’s a familiar tone to it that I can’t quite put my finger on. It finishes with a voluptuous piano and drum solo that is somewhat rare to find out in music now. It’s refined and the perfect way to end the album.</p>', 'images/33.png', '', 1, 2, 1, '2024-02-24 15:20:43', '2024-02-24 16:20:43'),
(34, 'Gravitas and Grandeur from pop\'s suave cynic', '<p>The slippery singer-songwriter remains bewitching, as sprightly brass-tinged arrangements deepen his songs’ darkness and brighten their romance</p>', '<p>Father John Misty’s gospel, if the slippery singer-songwriter had one, would be comically uninspiring. Love transforms you, but not much. Progress comes, not for long. When the times call for great social responsibility, such defeatism might sound convenient, but the indie-rock playboy born Josh Tillman takes cynicism all the way to the pulpit. He has faith in his non-belief, and summons you along with him.</p><p>A sold-out Eventim Apollo follows this dubious commentator into the dark. Tillman strides out in a trim suit and black shoes so sleekly polished they seem to reflect nonexistent chandeliers. He opens with a bleakly beguiling synth ballad (The Next 20th Century), before spending nearly two hours juggling screeds of social calamity with odes to romantic joy. He patrols the stage, taunting a spotlight’s cusp. Then his hips loosen. He primps for the front row, drops to his knees and theatrically pricks the air, cuing a cymbal crash. He has us.</p><p>His suave getup and old-Hollywood style – drawn from last year’s Chloë and the Next 20th Century LP – recall an era when entertainers were sexy and uncontroversial, if not always well-behaved. Could this, you find yourself wondering, be some sort of provocation? He covers Roy Orbison’s Oh, Pretty Woman, perhaps dreaming of simpler times for horny male songwriters, or perhaps not.</p><p>Inscrutable though he may be, Tillman is a delectable pop craftsman. “As you can tell from all the fake jazz music you heard earlier, I really struggled in the pandemic,” he jokes. His solution was to write sprightlier songs, honoured here with a brass trio that completes an eight-piece band.</p><p>Their new live arrangements elevate the love songs while dragging the jeremiads into thrilling depths. Pure Comedy, iffy on record, is transformed: squalling saxophones and synths give its mishmash of polemic and pseudoscience an air of profundity. Hangout at the Gallows, an oblique climate anti-anthem, is reborn with lashings of Bad Seeds gravitas. “What’s your politics? What’s your religion?” Tillman cries in the chorus, as if maddened by the inanity of such questions. But in the throes of his mania, the spotlight is all his.</p>', 'images/34.png', '', 1, 3, 1, '2024-02-28 15:20:43', '2024-02-28 16:20:43'),

Gray: Evolving Into Yourself', '<p>In 2019, the Salt Lake City resident and trained vocalist was tired of dealing with practice schedules and unpredictable bandmates. That’s when she went solo and started creating electronic music. It was never meant to be a live band; it was never meant to be more than just her.</p>', '<p>In 2019, the Salt Lake City resident and trained vocalist was tired of dealing with practice schedules and unpredictable bandmates. That’s when she went solo and started creating electronic music. It was never meant to be a live band; it was never meant to be more than just her. Eventually, Gray was persuaded into working with more bandmates and now doesn’t want the project to end. The current bandmates are Gray, Billy Tripps and Vyle Black, with another member expected to join the act soon. Locally, Lilly E. Gray is getting gigs opening for national acts such as Rosegarden Funeral Party and Aesthetic Perfection. They also recently played festivals like the Utah Dark Arts Festival at Area 51 and the Virtual Temple streaming festival on Twitch, and you may also find them on the darker JRC Events. Touring is an amazing part of any musician’s lifestyle, so naturally international and national gigs are always on the mind. When asked about which artists they would like to open for, the COP International artist Stabbing Westward immediately was mentioned. Gray says, “They are my second favorite band. Music is about living the dream—let us have our fingers crossed, because that would be an amazing show.” </p><p>Naturally, a name is important to an artist, and Gray “did what all good goth artists do … stole it off a headstone” at the Salt Lake Cemetery. It is there that a mysterious headstone reads “Lilly E. Gray, Victim of The Beast 666.” Gray always liked the sound of the name and felt it flowed well together. Combined with the spooky urban legends surrounding the headstone, you can understand why Gray chose the name.</p><p>Gray has long been the brains behind the songwriting while Black plays the guitar. Since 2019, their music has gone through the engineering and mastering process at Empire Recording Studio in Ogden, owned by the band’s drummer, Tripps. The studio has mastered artists like Max Ramble, Dan Welden and Brad Wheeler. The band likes to balance traditional instruments in their music with a natural progression toward electronic music. Sure, this includes forms of technology like A.I. software, but they never fear that these electronic elements will overpower the guitars in the mix. The ‘80s heavy metal and ‘90s alternative sounds have influenced each member and shows up in the band’s sound. Frustration and a touch of teenage angst are a common theme in the band’s music, and darker moods are what inspire Gray. It’s not all doom and gloom though—the band has positive songs as well. “Music is meant to make you better or at least calm you down and put you where you can focus or relax,” says Gray. </p><p>Production has begun on their fourth album, tentatively titled Autumn. The tracks have a frosty, solemn feeling that reminds Gray of fall and the color orange. Gray says, “There will still be some melancholy because that’s what I do. I write sad bastard music.” On the next release, you will find more of a collaboration in the writing and sounds throughout every aspect. The album’s first single is expected to be released in March. </p><p>Gray herself is transgender and an avid supporter of SLC’s LGBTQ+ communities. Though being trans in Utah comes with its challenges, Gray has appreciated being in an accepting community that allows her to be herself in a welcoming, safe environment. As for the band’s appearance, Lilly E. Gray sticks to a theme with coordinated colors and flashy costumes—they want to give something to the audience that is not just audibly but also aesthetically pleasing. It is another outlet to show their creativity. Gray says, “You can count on a dark aesthetic with some sparkle.” </p><p>The next time you see the name Lilly E. Gray playing on a bill, be sure not to miss them, and keep an ear out for their upcoming release Autumn. It is not just a band playing; it is a performance that delights the senses.</p>', 'images/35.png\r\n', '', 8, 3, 8, '2024-03-05 15:25:20', '2024-03-05 16:25:20'),

It\'s gonna be so, so amazing. Please let the shows happen — please.\"</p><p>In a separate interview with Rock Sound TV, Welch said \"We\'re just really brainstorming about how to do something new and fresh. \'Cause we\'ve been around so long.

(38, 'Paramore - This is Why', '<p>The pop-punk band have progressed from teenage bile to thirtysomething angst, expressed with agitated drumming, angular guitars, big riffs and heartfelt lyrics</p>', '<p>n 2007, Paramore released their breakthrough hit, Misery Business. It’s a song the band have a complicated relationship with. A few years ago, singer Hayley Williams began offering caveats about it – “I haven’t related to it in a very long time”, “I wrote it … because I was a dick”, “let’s celebrate that we’ve all done a lot of growing up since then” – then, for a period, declined to perform it at all. She made an exception for a guest appearance at Coachella with Billie Eilish, and Paramore returned the song to their sets last year, after four years not playing it. A song that tears vicious strips off a love rival, Misery Business has been dismissed by Williams as an example of “internalised misogyny”.</p><p>It’s definitely a potent expression of raw, unfiltered teenage bile – the kind of emotion that feels all-consuming at the time, but which makes you wince when you recall it years later – and its increasingly troubled position within Paramore’s oeuvre is a perfect example of the difficulties that can face artists who grow up in public. You might not have expected a combustible band who made their name with temper tantrums such as Misery Business to last long, but they’re still here, still filling stadiums, godparents to a younger generation of angsty singer-songwriters.</p><p>Their sixth studio album demonstrates why. It offers another slight shift in musical direction. Following its predecessor After Laughter’s diversion from pop punk to vibrant synth pop, This Is Why stirs 00s alt-rock into the mix: the band have mentioned Bloc Party and Foals as influences. It’s not a combination that works without fail: there are tracks where the teaming of scratchy guitars and big pop hooks recalls the moment when the post-punk sound of 00s indie crashed into a Britpop-ish desire to make the BBC Radio 1 A-list, with irksome results – particularly on the single C’est Comme Ça.</p><p>But you’re far more frequently struck by the deftness with which they weave the various aspects of their sound together: the agitated drumming and angular guitars meld with the big riffs and stop-start dynamics of pop-punk and an acute understanding of pop songcraft. The last doesn’t just express itself melodically. Liar is a lovely exhalation of a song and fairly obviously about Williams’ romantic relationship with the band’s guitarist, Taylor York – complete with lyrical reference to Williams’ solo track Crystal Clear, a song already picked over for inferences about said relationship by fans. If you think that’s a little odd – a heartfelt song about your deepest emotions with a line thrown in to stimulate discussion on message boards and social media – well, it’s very now. We live in a pop world shaped by Taylor Swift and her plethora of You’re So Vain-ish songs about famous exes, as evidenced by Miley Cyrus’ No 1 single Flowers and Shakira’s Gerard Piqué-bashing, YouTube-breaking Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol 53.</p><p>Elsewhere, there are songs about the polarisation of online discourse and the detrimental impact of 24-hour news, but the subject that dominates This Is Why is a distinctly late 20s/thirtysomething brand of angst: “My social life – a chiropractic appointment,” intones Williams at one juncture. Said angst’s various facets are picked over across a succession of tracks.</p><p>On Running Out of Time, Paramore evoke the sudden realisation that your time on Earth might not be as limitless as you once thought, and the fear that you’ve become a grownup without developing the skills to cope with adult life. Williams undercuts a succession of excuses with the blunt query: “What if I’m just a selfish prick?”</p><p>The creeping feeling that unbridled hedonism isn’t quite the sweet, consequence-free salve for your woes it once seemed to be haunts You First (“I can’t shake the devil off my shoulder”) while Crave works itself into a state about an inability to live in the moment. Eventually, Williams ends up pining for the days when the band could spit out a song like Misery Business without a second thought – “when all it took to make me cry was being alive”. Even the character assassination of Big Man, Little Dignity – “you have no integrity!” – is underscored by a weird envy at the apparent facility with which its subject lives his life.</p><p>This Is Why tackles millennial malaise really well and realistically: if your late 20s and early 30s are some way behind you, you still recognise the emotions it describes, while if you spent your teens howling along to Misery Business, it’s all likely to feel terribly pertinent. The second point is key. Growing up with your fans is not an easy thing to do: artists frequently end trapped at the point in their careers where they had their biggest success, offering a welcome burst of nostalgia for which fans endure a few new songs as payment. You would never say Paramore are maturing with ease – their business is anxieties and worries, after all – but they’re definitely doing it.</p>', 'images/38.png', '', 6, 2, 6, '2024-01-31 11:56:28', '2024-02-01 12:56:28');
